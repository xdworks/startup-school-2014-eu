*Urska Srsen-QWB8zO9yl24.mp4*[00：00：02]接下来，我们有一个地球摇瓶断言谁是庆祝和巴尔比帮助怀孕孕妇健康怀孕使用量化自我技术和Bellambi最近被承认为今年最创新的产品之一，部分归功于Szekeres惊人的品牌战略。

Now Urtica offers a different perspective to the stereotypical Silicon Valley founder.

现在，Urtica为这位硅谷创始人提供了不同的视角。

She attended the Finnish Academy of Fine Arts and by the age of 22 had exhibited her work through around the world.

她就读于芬兰美术学院，到22岁时，她在世界各地展出了她的作品。

So welcome Esker.

欢迎Esker。

Applaud.

鼓掌。

Hello my name is Christian and I\'m the co-founder of Kelabit.

你好，我叫克里斯蒂安，我是凯拉比特的联合创始人。

 \[00:00:58\] Bella.

[00：00：58]贝拉。

It is a company developing systems for self tracking during pregnancy.

这是一家开发系统的公司，在怀孕期间进行自我跟踪。

In order to help expectant mothers to lead a healthier lifestyle during pregnancy.

为了帮助孕妇在怀孕期间过上更健康的生活方式。

So Bella Ebeid as a product is a device an app that allows future moms to listen to their baby\'s heartbeat and share the experience with their loved ones.

因此，Bella Ebeid作为一种产品，是一款应用程序，可以让未来的妈妈听到孩子的心跳，并与他们的亲人分享这段经历。

So in other words we\'re bringing Quantified Self movement to pregnancy.

换句话说，我们要给怀孕带来量化的自我运动。

Thank you very much for inviting me as I\'m very happy that I\'ve gotten the opportunity to share our story with you.

非常感谢你邀请我，因为我很高兴有机会和你分享我们的故事。

Sandra and myself started the company in 2012.

桑德拉和我于2012年创立了这家公司。

So a year and a half ago somewhere between Slovenia and Croatia because that\'s where we\'re from.

一年半前，斯洛文尼亚和克罗地亚之间的某个地方，因为那是我们的家乡。

And.

和

Writing this speech was actually a really hard thing to do as you often hear.

就像你经常听到的那样，写这篇演讲实际上是一件非常困难的事情。

And also Fijis said that having a startup is like being repeatedly punched in your face.

菲吉斯还说，拥有一家初创公司就像被人打了一拳一样。

So writing this speech was basically a reflecting about upon the beating that we have already received than that.

所以写这篇演讲基本上是对我们已经受到的打击的反思。

We know that bombs stopped for a very long time cild.

我们知道炸弹停了很久。

So he was actually also Sundra that was supposed to write a speech for me because I\'m the head of designer head designer head of product.

所以他也是Sundra，他应该为我写一篇演讲，因为我是产品设计师的负责人。

So as we\'re going into prototyping of our new products next week I literally didn\'t have a second to think about anything else than just that Sandro contract as the CEO could afford a little bit more time.

因此，当我们下周开始制作新产品的原型时，除了桑德罗(Sandro)的合同，我真的没有时间去想其他事情了，因为首席执行官可以多花一点时间。

But anyways even as he is the main the bigger visionary behind our company and a bit more experience.

但无论如何，即使他是主要的，更大的远见，我们的公司和更多的经验。

Founder.

方正。

And like the only thing you could do kabab was just good luck.

就像你唯一能做的就是好运。

So.

所以

I just started to just try to describe how we started.

我只是试着描述一下我们是怎么开始的。

 \[00:03:01\] We are still a pretty early stage startup so as I said we started a year and a half ago.

[00：03：01]我们还处于起步阶段，所以正如我所说的，我们是一年半前开始的。

Right now we are a team of 20 people.

现在我们是一个由20人组成的团队。

We are present on the European American and Australian market and have sold our devices in thousands.

我们目前在欧洲，美国和澳大利亚市场，并已出售我们的设备数以千计。

But still that\'s still a pretty early stage.

但这还只是个早期阶段。

And.

和

I\'ll just try to describe from the beginning of how we started and how we managed to survive.

我只想从一开始就描述一下我们是如何开始的，我们是如何生存的。

 \[00:03:34\] Through this year and a half.

[00：03：34]过了一年半。

So.

所以

My background is a bit.

我的背景有点。

Sorry.

抱歉的

How did I get myself into this.

我是怎么把自己牵扯进来的。

 \[00:03:46\] I\'ve always thought that I am the most unlikely person to start a tech company.

[00：03：46]我一直认为我是最不可能创办一家科技公司的人。

I dropped out of med school to study fine art sculpture.

我从医学院辍学去学习美术雕塑。

Yes my parents are very proud about that because I thought that you can only work on something that you really love and care about.

是的，我的父母对此感到非常自豪，因为我认为你只能在你真正热爱和关心的事情上工作。

That\'s the only way how you can reach up to your full potential.

只有这样，你才能充分发挥自己的潜能。

 \[00:04:10\] And I thought that everything else is just a waste of mine and everybody else\'s time.

[00：04：10]我认为其他一切都只是在浪费我和其他人的时间。

So when I got myself into med school I kind of let myself down because that was one of those decisions that you easily make when.

所以当我进入医学院的时候，我有点失望，因为这是你很容易做出的决定之一。

Things are expected of you.

人们对你的期望很高。

Anyhow I never repeated any of that.

不管怎样，我从来没有重复过这些。

 \[00:04:30\] For makes mistakes again and I was well on my way to become a sculptor and in my work I was really obsessed with life imprinting my body strength upon physical material and I wanted to transfer my thoughts and emotions into other people\'s minds.

[00：04：30]我又犯了错误，我在成为雕刻家的路上做得很好。在我的工作中，我真的痴迷于生活，把我的身体力量印在物质上，我想把我的思想和情感转移到别人的头脑中。

And as it happened I like doing that with a chainsaw.

碰巧我喜欢用电锯做这件事。

Yes I did this intro just so that I go and show this picture but I also wanted to talk about my background a bit because I think it does reflect upon my work as a founder.

是的，我做这个介绍只是为了展示这张照片，但我也想谈谈我的背景，因为我认为它反映了我作为创始人的工作。

Today it has taught me a few things.

今天它教会了我一些东西。

And that is that working as a founder or as an artist is very personal.

也就是说，作为创办人或艺术家的工作是非常个人化的。

So that\'s why it\'s going to get very emotionally stressful.

所以这就是为什么它会在情绪上产生很大的压力。

And also you can find yourselves.

你们也能找到自己。

You can find yourself very alone in it.

你会发现自己很孤独。

It\'s also very hard to let go let other people\'s people see your work and evaluated because often they\'re just going to shred to pieces.

让别人看到你的作品并对你进行评估也是非常困难的，因为他们经常会被撕成碎片。

And you have to crawl back to your garage and do it all over again and again or try fix it until you succeed.

你必须爬回你的车库，一遍又一遍地做，或者试着修复它，直到你成功。

Even though there is no general recipe for success.

即使没有一般的成功秘诀。

Because Stata such an unpredictable mixture of material people execution and momentum that it\'s really hard to predict the outcome but the prospects of this really amazing outcome that we see over and over again is something that really drives founders.

因为斯塔塔是物质、人员、执行力和动力的一个不可预测的混合体，所以很难预测结果，但我们一遍又一遍地看到这个令人惊讶的结果的前景，确实是推动创始人的动力。

 \[00:06:10\] The other thing that really drive drives drives founders to start their own company is working on their own ideas.

[00：06：10]真正推动创始人创业的另一件事是自己的想法。

So trying to realize something they\'ve come up with or fix something build something from their own needs.

所以，试着去实现一些他们想出的东西，或者修复一些东西，从他们自己的需求中构建一些东西。

We haven\'t really started Bella beed from our own need.

我们还没有真正从我们自己的需要出发。

 \[00:06:32\] We started Butterby because Sandra my co-founder wanted to find a way of how to get me back from Finland and work with him.

[00：06：32]我们创办巴特比，是因为我的联合创始人桑德拉想找到一种方法，让我从芬兰回来，和他一起工作。

So he thought that the best way to do that was just getting my whole family involved because my mom\'s an OBD wine and when he heard us she\'s had burned all the department in University Clinical Center in euglena Slovenia.

因此，他认为最好的办法就是让我全家都参与进来，因为我妈妈是OBD葡萄酒，当他听说我们时，她已经烧毁了斯洛文尼亚尤格莱纳大学临床中心的所有部门。

 \[00:06:58\] He started to sniff around like what can we do there.

[00：06：58]他开始嗅来闻去，就像我们在那里能做些什么一样。

And he figured that.

他猜到了。

Care providers at this institution.

这家机构的护理提供者。

Have been talking about remote patient monitoring system for a really long time.

已经谈论了很长一段时间的远程病人监控系统。

 \[00:07:13\] As they wanted to better care for the patients while reducing the costs of public healthcare.

[00：07：13]因为他们希望在降低公共医疗费用的同时更好地照顾病人。

But as they say public healthcare they didn\'t really have any initiative or resources to build something real.

但就像他们说的那样，他们没有任何主动性或资源去建立真正的东西。

So.

所以

Sandra thought.

桑德拉想。

We\'ll just build a professional remote patient monitoring system and save the world.

我们将建立一个专业的远程病人监控系统，拯救世界。

 \[00:07:37\] Fix the problem.

[00：07：37]解决问题。

I\'ll just make this really long story short of how he managed to convince me to drop drop off of my aspiring career as an artist and go buy a computer.

我只想让这个长话短说，说明他是如何说服我放弃我的艺术家职业生涯，去买一台电脑的。

Yes I didn\'t have a computer before I learned how to use photoshop illustrator start working on a user interface design.

是的，在我学会如何使用Photoshop插画之前，我还没有一台电脑，我开始着手进行用户界面设计。

 \[00:08:01\] And I\'ll also cut the part when we have no idea what we were doing.

[00：08：01]当我们不知道自己在做什么的时候，我也会剪掉这部分。

Like completely no idea we were mostly just getting on my mom\'s nerves with stupid questions and like impossible solutions.

就像完全不知道，我们大多只是用愚蠢的问题和不可能的解决办法激怒了我妈妈的神经。

But anyways we kind of managed to get to a working prototype so we managed to build something that could someday become a remote patient monitoring system.

但是无论如何，我们设法找到了一个工作的原型，所以我们成功地构建了某一天可以成为远程病人监控系统的东西。

And there we sat with this prototype and thought.

我们坐在那里，拿着这个原型，思考着。

If we\'re building.

如果我们在建造。

Such an important system that\'s fixing such a big problem why isn\'t people just calling us.

一个如此重要的系统，正在修复如此大的问题，为什么人们不只是打电话给我们。

And then we realized that we were doing everything completely wrong.

然后我们意识到我们所做的一切都是完全错误的。

 \[00:08:47\] We were building something from a professional and care provider perspective.

[00：08：47]从专业和护理提供者的角度来看，我们正在建造一些东西。

So technically it was perfect but it was also very complicated.

所以从技术上讲，它是完美的，但也是非常复杂的。

And almost impossible to implement.

几乎不可能实现。

The other problem that we had word to patients they didn\'t feel motivated to start using something like that.

另一个问题是，我们告诉病人，他们没有动力开始使用类似的药物。

They didn\'t feel they\'re engaged enough in prenatal care to trust something like that.

他们觉得自己没有足够的时间去做产前护理，不能相信这样的事情。

They also felt that prenatal care is lacking an emotional and social aspect.

他们还认为产前护理缺乏情感和社会方面。

So we thought alright we can fix this problem by approaching it from another perspective.

所以我们认为，好的，我们可以通过从另一个角度来解决这个问题。

So we.

所以我们。

Scaled it all down turn it around and started to build it from again from the bottom up.

把它缩小，把它转过来，然后从下到上重新开始建造它。

So we scaled down to a consumer product that would slowly start introducing patients to self tracking during pregnancy through an easy to understand emotional experience.

因此，我们缩减到一种消费产品，通过一种易于理解的情感体验，慢慢地开始向患者介绍怀孕期间的自我跟踪。

 \[00:09:55\] So allowing them to include other people also in their prenatal care and their experience of pregnancy.

[00：09：55]允许他们也包括其他人在他们的产前护理和他们的怀孕经验。

And then we found ourselves before an even greater challenge.

然后我们发现自己面临着更大的挑战。

Like basically in deep trouble we were building hardware and we were entering one of the most competitive markets right now.

就像我们基本上陷入了严重的麻烦一样，我们正在建造硬件，我们现在正进入最具竞争力的市场之一。

So that\'s the wearables market.

这就是可穿戴设备的市场。

 \[00:10:21\] We have learned a couple of things about wearables already and that is that we\'re still pretty early on with them.

[00：10：21]我们已经学到了一些关于可穿戴设备的东西，那就是我们对它们的研究还很早。

And that\'s why it\'s very hard to predict what is the real future for them.

这就是为什么很难预测他们真正的未来。

But.

但

Having built something such as a remote patient monitoring system and then scaling it down to a consumer product we kind of came to a thought and maybe a consumer maybe wearables are just that they the consumer products that are paving the way for digitalization in professional health care.

在建立了远程病人监控系统，然后将其缩小到消费产品之后，我们产生了这样的想法，也许是消费者，也许是可穿戴设备，它们只是为专业医疗数字化铺平了道路的消费品。

The only thing that has to happen is that these devices start providing so reliable data and they become so seamlessly integrated into users wear and lifestyle and habits that they become a part of our everyday life and start transforming the way we take care of our health.

唯一需要发生的是，这些设备开始提供如此可靠的数据，它们会无缝地融入用户的穿着、生活方式和习惯，从而成为我们日常生活的一部分，并开始改变我们照顾健康的方式。

We also think that pregnancy might be the best entry point for that.

我们还认为怀孕可能是最好的切入点。

As well that preventive can start minimizing the risks of complications that are becoming more frequent due to consequences of our modern lifestyle such as obesity and sedentary lifestyle and stress.

同样，预防可以开始将并发症的风险降到最低，这些并发症由于我们现代生活方式的后果，如肥胖、久坐的生活方式和压力而变得越来越频繁。

Well I\'m I\'m very enthusiastic about wearables and changing the health care and how it can transform our lifestyle but.

我非常热衷于可穿戴设备和改变医疗保健，以及它如何改变我们的生活方式，但是。

I also wanted to touch a little about a little bit the other side of building a startup more exactly how it feels to be a European Founder.

我还想接触一下创业的另一面，更确切地说，作为一名欧洲创始人的感觉。

And then transferring to the states or more like how to be a young European founder.

然后转到美国，或者更喜欢如何成为一名年轻的欧洲创始人。

So.

所以

There is a conception that it\'s very hard for people to build.

有一种观念认为人们很难建立。

 \[00:12:25\] Tech companies in Europe and that it\'s also very hard to build startups in the States.

[00：12：25]欧洲的科技公司，在美国创业也很困难。

As a European founder.

作为欧洲的创始人。

And it\'s both.

两者兼而有之。

Very true.

非常正确。

 \[00:12:38\] And fortunately I think that Europe still hasn\'t fully grasped the potential of technology and the way startups are build today.

[00：12：38]幸运的是，我认为欧洲还没有充分掌握技术的潜力和今天创业的方式。

Starting our company from you know the uncharted part of Europe practically in business sense we realize that.

你知道，从商业意义上说，我们从欧洲的未知地区开始我们的公司，我们意识到了这一点。

 \[00:13:01\] Europe is a very tough market to crack.

[00：13：01]欧洲是一个很难打开的市场。

It\'s very fragmented.

它非常零碎。

It\'s very stiff.

它很硬。

And having a shady passport and educational background does not how you get to talk to right people.

拥有不可靠的护照和教育背景并不能让你和合适的人交谈。

Connections do matter and getting to the right people.

人际关系和找到合适的人确实很重要。

Needs a lot of Rosenthal\'s scheming.

需要很多罗森塔尔的阴谋。

But the other thing that happens in Europe is that having been brought up in a place where it\'s virtually really hard to get any resources.

但在欧洲发生的另一件事是，在一个几乎很难获得任何资源的地方长大。

Use.

使用

You learn how to build stuff from from basically scratch you don\'t need a lot of things so you become very resents list.

你学会了如何从头开始构建东西，你不需要太多的东西，所以你变得非常反感。

But then we thought.

但后来我们想。

If we could only bridge over to the States things will become so much easier.

如果我们能连接到美国，事情就会变得容易得多。

So.

所以

As.

就像。

It happened this is the point that the biggest luck factor in our history happened.

这是我们历史上最幸运的原因。

And.

和

It was while we applied for the Pioneers Festival competition in late 2013.

当我们在2013年底申请先锋节比赛的时候。

 \[00:14:23\] There was also the point where we\'re kind of you know running out of money.

[00：14：23]还有一点，你知道，我们的钱快用完了。

We did have a product on the on the market and we were getting traction.

我们在市场上确实有一种产品，而且我们得到了发展。

But to cover all the all the things that come with it we needed to hire more more people and we didn\'t have any money we didn\'t have any knowledge of marketing of P R so we had this great product that we really believe in but we didn\'t know how to get the word out.

但为了涵盖所有随之而来的事情，我们需要雇佣更多的人，我们没有钱，我们没有任何的市场营销知识，所以我们有这个伟大的产品，我们真的相信，但我们不知道如何得到消息。

So that\'s why we applied for a defined Year competition which is one of the biggest startup challenges in in Europe.

这就是为什么我们申请了一个确定的年度竞争，这是欧洲最大的创业挑战之一。

And.

和

As it happened we were there pitching I was in the finals the only girl beating against guys building stuff with Nossa another dude don\'t believe in your in your product or your team.

碰巧我们在那里投球，我在决赛中，唯一的一个女孩，击败家伙，与另一个家伙建立的东西，不相信你的产品或你的球队。

We really believed in it.

我们真的相信它。

But still those moments are times when you know you start thinking that like everybody is building amazing products and there are so many people that are starting startups today.

但是，那些时刻，你知道，你开始认为，就像每个人都在建立惊人的产品，有这么多的人，正在创业今天。

 \[00:15:34\] How can I compete with them.

[00：15：34]我怎么能和他们竞争？

How can I even be competitive.

我怎么能有竞争力。

And you know those are just the things that when the moments when you have to just like you know.

你知道，这些只是当你必须知道的时刻，就像你所知道的那样。

Suck it up and your thing.

吸吮它和你的东西。

And we did.

我们做到了。

And.

和

As a matter of fact we didn\'t only win the competition.

事实上，我们不仅赢得了比赛。

This is also when we amassed one of the coolest guys that we ever met.

这也是当我们聚集了一个最酷的人，我们见过。

And that\'s Michael Siebel.

那是迈克尔？西贝尔。

And he invited us to apply for Y Combinator.

他邀请我们申请Y组合。

So I won the competition and came down from the stage.

所以我赢得了比赛，从舞台上下来。

And Michael was like Have you ever considered applying for a Y Combinator.

迈克尔就像你曾经考虑过申请Y组合。

And I had no idea what he was talking about.

我不知道他在说什么。

Later on I went to Sandra and I was like there was this guy and he asked me Do we want to go to my university.

后来我去了桑德拉，就像有个人问我，我们想上大学吗？

 \[00:16:36\] And I suddenly was like Do you like this is one of the biggest you know accelerators for startups.

[00：16：36]我突然觉得这是创业公司最大的加速器之一。

So he obviously knows a lot more about startup than I do.

所以他对创业的了解显然比我多。

 \[00:16:48\] But anyway so luckily we did apply and we did got accepted and we moved to the states in a matter of two weeks of meeting Michael.

[00：16：48]但是无论如何，幸运的是，我们确实申请了，我们确实被录取了，我们在两个星期的会见中就搬到了美国。

And then all of a sudden we were part of this much more open discourse on technology and this accepting environment like everybody is building amazing companies and everybody succeeding.

然后，突然间，我们参与了关于技术的更加开放的讨论，这种接受环境，就像每个人一样，正在建立令人惊叹的公司，每个人都成功了。

There\'s so much money to give.

有这么多钱可以给。

But.

但

Then.

然后

 \[00:17:21\] And  \[00:17:21\] then I thought well at least everything is not going to be that hard now.

[00：17：21]和[00：17：21]然后我想，至少现在一切都不会那么艰难了。

Well I was completely wrong.

我完全错了。

Like all of a sudden you find yourself competing on the market with people who are native in just about everything you\'re not native and like you can\'t literally even answer an email right.

就像突然之间，你发现自己在市场上和那些在所有事情上都是本地人的人竞争，你不是土生土长，甚至连一封电子邮件都不能直接回复。

 \[00:17:42\] Imagine doing a customer service to pregnant women when your English is like a bit sketchy or like it\'s complete the stress factor.

[00：17：42]想象一下，当你的英语有点粗略，或者说它是完成压力因素的时候，你会为孕妇做一次客户服务。

But anyways we kind of.

但不管怎样我们。

 \[00:17:54\] Like just try to do compete on the market and the market is very much more homogenic I\'ll just stop that.

[00：17：54]就像试着在市场上竞争一样，市场上的同源性要高得多，我就停止了。

Laughter.

笑声。

It\'s too painful.

太痛苦了。

Anyway so we started to compete on the market and we were gaining traction.

不管怎么说，我们开始在市场上竞争，我们获得了吸引力。

We were gaining a lot of interest from foreign distributors as well and investors.

我们从外国分销商和投资者那里获得了很大的兴趣。

 \[00:18:21\] And we just stick to the recipe that we see partners like to gave that any problem is best to overcome with working more.

[00：18：21]我们坚持我们看到的合作伙伴喜欢给出的配方，任何问题都最好用更多的工作来克服。

And.

和

By the time we move to the Y C we were living together as a team for five months already.

当我们搬到YC的时候，我们已经一起住了五个月了。

Like leaving together eating together.

就像一起离开一起吃饭一样。

Not showering but still like everything together.

不洗澡，但还是喜欢一切在一起。

And so we never really scaled down on the work part.

因此，我们从来没有真正缩小工作部分。

They also advise people to exercise.

他们还建议人们运动。

We\'re kind of cheated on that but still we stick to.

我们在这件事上被骗了，但我们还是坚持。

Work hard talk to customers write your code and it\'s kind of did the magic.

努力与客户交谈，写出你的代码，这就有点神奇了。

By the time we were pitching on why I see them today.

当我们开始思考为什么我今天看到他们的时候。

We\'ve already sold more than 8000 devices.

我们已经销售了8000多台设备。

So we had a really good traction.

所以我们有了很好的牵引力。

We managed to expand to theU.S.

我们设法将业务扩展到美国。

market.

市场。

And like I said before we were getting a lot of interest from investors.

就像我之前说的，投资者对我们很感兴趣。

So.

所以

Everything after demo day led to closing a seed round in just a matter of two weeks.

演示一天之后的每一件事都在短短两周的时间内就结束了。

And we were kind of like we didn\'t get very many news like we weren\'t rejected very much.

我们好像没有得到太多的消息，就像我们没有被拒绝一样。

And at the time we were kind of like a bit freaked out because we always listen to these stories of you know this amazing founders being through all these rejection before they made it.

当时我们有点抓狂，因为我们总是听这些故事，你知道，这位了不起的创始人在他们做出这一切之前，经历了这么多的拒绝。

And we were just there you know like.

我们就在那里你知道的。

You know receiving this funding.

你知道收到这笔资金。

And then we reflected a bit on our history too that led up to that moment and we actually realized that we did receive a lot of rejection.

然后，我们也反思了一下我们的历史，直到那一刻，我们才意识到我们确实遭到了很多的拒绝。

It\'s just that we got we were very used to it and we kind of like forgot.

只是我们已经习惯了，我们有点忘记了。

Bye bye.

拜拜

By the time.

到那时

You see when you\'re.

你知道当你.。

Starting a company somewhere where it\'s very hard to get any support.

在一个很难得到支持的地方创办一家公司。

You just like you just learn how to take rejection and you learn how to do things from how to build things from nothing.

你就像你刚刚学会了如何接受拒绝，你学会了如何从一无所有的事情中去做事情。

We basically built our prototype a working prototype with less than five thousand euros.

我们基本上建立了我们的原型-一个不到5000欧元的工作原型。

And that also makes you very strong as a founder and as a person.

这也使你作为一个创始人和一个人非常强大。

So.

所以

Kind of like in conclusion I would like to say that the things that we\'ve learned through our journey that led up to this day is that.

最后，我想说的是，我们在旅途中学到的东西，直到今天。

What really kept us surviving is a really strong team.

真正让我们生存下来的是一支非常强大的队伍。

We always stick together.

我们总是团结在一起。

We always pull through somehow.

我们总是能挺过去的。

Really good execution.

执行得很好。

We have a good product that customers like and we\'re making it better everyday by talking to them and finding ways of how can how we can impress them more.

我们有一个客户喜欢的好产品，我们每天都在和他们交谈，想办法给他们留下更好的印象。

And then also like I said before like Europe.

就像我之前说过的，就像欧洲一样。

Is a very good place to breed resilient and resourceful founders.

是一个很好的地方培养弹性和足智多谋的创始人。

Thank you very much.

非常感谢

Applause.
