*Hiroki Takeuchi-s4RBfIwUBgY.mp4*\[00：00：03]现在转到下一位发言者。

This afternoon.

今天下午。

 \[00:00:06\] Hiroki is co-founder and CEO of Go club go cardless which is the ukase leading direct debit provider and they now serve more businesses than any other direct debit provider and they\'re also expanding to serve Europe.

[00：00：06]Hiroki是Go俱乐部Go无卡公司的联合创始人和首席执行官，该公司是Kukase领先的直接借记卡提供商，他们现在为更多的业务服务，比其他任何直接借记卡提供商都多，而且他们还在扩展业务，为欧洲服务。

Hiroki and his co-founder Matt started go cardless in 2010.

广基和他的联合创始人马特在2010年开始了无纸化。

So they\'ve got a fun story to be telling you about their history.

所以他们有一个有趣的故事要告诉你他们的历史。

It\'s a really bright eyed pair and I think that\'s a good thing I can kind of barely see the back so I can\'t really see how many people in the room right now.

这是一双非常明亮的眼睛，我认为这是一件好事，我几乎看不到后面，所以我现在看不出房间里有多少人。

 \[00:00:49\] Say hi I\'m Hiroki and I start to go cardless actually in the beginning of 2011 with my co-founder is Matt and Tom.

[00：00：49]跟我打招呼，我是广基，实际上是在2011年初，我和我的联合创始人马特和汤姆开始没有卡了。

For those of you that don\'t know about what we do basically we make it really easy for businesses to accept recurring payments via direct debit.

对于那些不知道我们做了什么的人来说，我们让企业很容易接受通过直接借记的经常性付款。

When Kate asked me to talk at Startup School she asked me to talk about the early stages of Go cardless and tell our story.

当凯特让我在创业学校演讲时，她让我谈一谈“无卡”的早期阶段，并讲述我们的故事。

And so when I was thinking through our story I was trying to figure out okay what should I talk about.

所以当我在思考我们的故事时，我试图弄清楚，我应该说些什么。

And I realized that actually for me the lessons I\'ve learned they didn\'t come from.

我意识到，对我来说，我学到的教训并不来自于我。

Just you specific events so one story here or there the lessons that I learned over time.

只是你的具体事件，所以这里或那里的一个故事，我学到的教训，随着时间的推移。

And so rather than telling you are straight story I thought I\'d share for lessons that I\'ve learned along the way and then give you some anecdotes as well.

因此，与其告诉你的是直截了当的故事，我还以为我会分享我沿途学到的教训，然后给你一些轶事。

 \[00:01:47\] See if this works.

[00：01：47]看看这是否有效。

Okay.

好的。

So.

所以

Our first story.

我们的第一个故事。

Is about.

是关于。

When your journey starts actually that your journey starts way earlier than you think.

当你的旅程开始的时候，你的旅程比你想象的要早得多。

 \[00:02:01\] When I sat down to really think about this talk and start thinking about what\'s the story of Go cardless and where did it begin.

[00：02：01]当我坐下来认真思考这个演讲，开始思考什么是无纸化的故事，它是从哪里开始的。

Actually turned out to be a pretty non-trivial question.

实际上是个相当重要的问题。

Was it when we wrote our first line of code.

是我们写第一行代码的时候。

Or was it when Matt Tom and myself agreed to start a business together.

或者是马特·汤姆和我同意一起创业的时候。

Or perhaps it was when.

也可能是在什么时候。

Matt and I met for the first time when we shared our dreams of starting a business one day.

马特和我第一次见面是因为有一天我们一起分享了创业的梦想。

 \[00:02:31\] But then I realized that for me my story began way earlier than that.

[00：02：31]但后来我意识到，对我来说，我的故事开始得早于此。

My story began in the first week of university.

我的故事始于大学的第一周。

I\'d go to university and know like most people you meet lots of new friends you try out new activities and take up new hobbies.

我会去上大学，像大多数人一样，你会遇到很多新朋友，你会尝试新的活动，开始新的爱好。

It was during then that I met a guy called Carreau.

就在那期间我遇到了一个叫卡洛的人。

He was in the year above me and he did maths too.

他比我高一，他也学数学。

And.

和

He kind of took me under his wing and in one of those first weeks he took me to meet up for this society called Oxford entrepreneurs.

他把我放在他的羽翼下，在最初的几个星期里，他带我去参加一个叫做牛津企业家的协会。

Basically it was a Students Society that was there to promote entrepreneurship.

基本上，这是一个学生协会，是为了促进企业家精神。

And.

和

I remember my eyes being open for the first time.

我记得我第一次睁开眼睛。

This world of startups and business.

这个充满创业和商业的世界。

Before that I had no idea what it was about.

在那之前我不知道是怎么回事。

I thought business was like Lex Luthor andMr.

我以为生意就像莱克斯·卢瑟先生和先生。

Burns.

伯恩斯。

And.

和

So I remember going to this event and meeting all these really cool people that were interested in taking this other path.

所以我记得去参加这个活动，见过所有那些对走另一条路感兴趣的很酷的人。

And it was there that I met Corvair and Harge going to kill me when they see this picture because an awful picture of them.

就在那里，我遇到了科尔维尔和哈吉，当他们看到这张照片时，他们会杀了我，因为他们的照片很糟糕。

But.

但

They were the first people that I met that had started a business.

他们是我认识的第一个创业的人。

Now you gotta remember back in the you know 2005 2006 when they started their business.

现在你要记住，在你知道的2005年，2006年，他们创业的时候。

No one was doing that in London everyone was going into banking or law.

在伦敦，没有人这样做，每个人都进入银行业或法律界。

And these guys decided to quit their jobs and start a business together and pursue their dreams and I found that fascinating.

这些人决定辞掉工作，一起创业，追求他们的梦想，我发现这很吸引人。

So when they decided to move out to San Francisco.

所以当他们决定搬到旧金山的时候。

I knew that I needed to persuade them to give me an internship.

我知道我需要说服他们给我一个实习机会。

In the summer of 2007 those guys finally relented and said Okay cool.

在2007年夏天，这些家伙终于松懈了，说“好酷”。

Come and join us for the summer.

来和我们一起过暑假吧。

And when I got there it turns out that they\'d actually teamed up with a guy called Patrick who\'s actually on stage earlier and they started automatic together.

当我到了那里，结果发现他们实际上和一个叫帕特里克的家伙合作，他实际上在舞台上更早，他们开始自动合作。

It was basically an inventory management tool for eBay power sellers.

它基本上是易趣电力卖家的库存管理工具。

That\'s them at a conference with them.

那是他们和他们开的会。

I like being on top T.

我喜欢上T。

It was on top of auctions that is.

那是在拍卖会上。

And.

和

I got to see firsthand what it was like to be in the earlier stages of being in a startup.

我要亲眼目睹创业初期的感觉。

I remember getting that.

我记得收到过。

And we spent two months living and working out of this tiny apartment in San Francisco.

我们花了两个月的时间在旧金山的这间小公寓里生活和工作。

It was a two bedroom place and there were six of us.

那是一个两居室的地方，我们有六个人。

We had three air mattresses between us and we had to sleep in shifts so that we wouldn\'t knock into each other in the night.

我们之间有三张气垫，我们不得不轮流睡觉，这样我们就不会在晚上撞到对方了。

That summer I spent the time my time just doing customer interviews.

那年夏天，我把时间花在做客户访谈上。

Testing out the product by selling lasers that we imported from China.

通过销售我们从中国进口的激光来测试产品。

They were so powerful that you could hit a aeroplane out in the sky with them.

他们太强大了，你可以和他们一起撞上天上的飞机。

I remember this one time we did it and we thought we were going to get caught by the police.

我记得有一次我们做了这件事，我们以为我们会被警察抓住。

And.

和

I also was surrounded by all of these developers and learn about what coding was.

我还被所有这些开发人员包围，了解编码是什么。

Before that I\'d never really been exposed to it.

在此之前，我从未真正接触过它。

I also got a chance to go to Y Combinator and see what those dinners were like and I heard some of the stories from founders back then.

我也有机会去Y Combinator，看看那些晚餐是什么样的，那时我听到了一些创建者的故事。

So.

所以

When it came to starting my business.

当我开始做生意的时候。

I realized that I learned so much from my experiences.

我意识到我从我的经历中学到了很多。

Automatic.

自动的。

When I first met Matt would we have had a debate about the pros and cons of.

当我第一次见到马特的时候，我们会讨论一下。

Cofounders versus starting a business on your own.

联合创始人和你自己创业的对比。

Or.

或

When it came to starting and building our first product.

开始和建造我们的第一个产品。

Would I have learnt the value of coding.

我会学到编码的价值吗。

 \[00:06:19\] Would I have even applied for Y Combinator had it not been for the experiences that I had then.

[00：06：19]如果没有我当时的经历，我甚至会申请Y组合器。

I\'m not sure we would have.

我不确定我们会不会。

So remember that your journey starts way before you think it does.

所以请记住，你的旅程在你认为开始之前就已经开始了。

And.

和

If you want to start a business one day.

如果有一天你想创业。

Then think about what you can be doing right now to learn about what you what you\'ll be doing in the future because you never know what\'s going to be useful.

然后想想你现在能做什么，去了解你将来会做什么，因为你永远不知道什么是有用的。

So.

所以

My second story lesson is about.

我的第二个故事是关于。

 \[00:06:53\] Being careful of white board ideas.

[00：06：53]注意白板的想法。

I\'ll explain what I mean by that.

我会解释我的意思。

When I met Matt for the first time it was when we first started it was our first jobs out of university and we were working as management consultants for our sins.

当我第一次见到马特的时候，那是我们刚开始工作的时候，这是我们大学毕业后的第一份工作，当时我们正在为我们的罪恶做管理顾问。

 \[00:07:10\] And we quickly realized that we had a shared interest in starting a business.

[00：07：10]我们很快意识到我们对创业有共同的兴趣。

Maybe one day we\'d want to start a business together.

也许有一天我们会一起创业。

I remember we used to spend hours in between projects and on the weekends.

我记得我们过去常常在项目之间和周末花上几个小时。

Just toying with ideas bouncing around on boards concocting plans of what we might be able to start one day.

只是玩弄想法，在板上跳跃，编造出我们可能有一天能开始的计划。

I also remember that we had this really terrible pattern where every time we came up with an idea we then spend the next week or few days just tearing it apart and realizing how terrible an idea it was.

我还记得，我们有一个非常可怕的模式，每次我们想出一个想法，接下来的一周或几天，我们就把它撕成碎片，意识到这个想法是多么糟糕。

 \[00:07:43\] This was all done on a whiteboard.

[00：07：43]这一切都是在白板上完成的。

So when it came to leaving our jobs and we decided that we were going to take the plunge and start a business we still don\'t actually have.

因此，当谈到离开我们的工作时，我们决定冒险创业，开始一个我们还没有真正拥有的企业。

An idea of what we wanted to do.

我们想做什么。

We hadn\'t settled on something we were excited about.

我们还没有决定要做什么让我们兴奋的事情。

And now it turns out that actually.

现在事实证明。

Doing that and telling your friends that you\'re starting a business but you don\'t know what it is yet is a really great forcing mechanism.

这样做，并告诉你的朋友，你正在创业，但你不知道是什么，这是一个真正伟大的强制机制。

We quickly joined forces with Tom and decided to start something called Green Day.

我们很快和汤姆联合起来，决定开始一个叫做“绿色日”的活动。

This is one of my early designs and.

这是我早期的设计之一。

The idea is this.

想法是这样的。

If you or a football captain of your local team or you going on holiday with your friends.

如果你或者当地球队的足球队长或者你和你的朋友一起去度假。

Then.

然后

Collecting money for those informal situations is a real pain.

为这些非正式情况筹集资金是一种真正的痛苦。

So we wanted to start something to fix that.

所以我们想开始做点什么来解决这个问题。

I\'m going to fast forward a little bit now and the story in this is six months later we were out in Silicon Valley and we were working out of an apartment in the mission.

我现在要快进一点，故事是六个月后，我们在硅谷，我们在任务中的一套公寓里工作。

We were on Y Combinator and we had a prototype of this product that we were trying to get anyone and everyone to use.

我们在YCombinator上，我们有一个这个产品的原型，我们试图让任何人和每个人使用。

We were quickly approaching Demo Day which is the culmination of the Y Combinator program.

我们很快就要到演示日了，这是Y组合器项目的高潮。

It\'s when all of the founders of Y Combinator get into a room and present this to a room full of the who\'s who of investors in Silicon Valley.

当YCombinator的所有创始人都走进一个房间，把这个展示给硅谷的投资者中充满了谁的人的房间。

But we had a little bit of a problem.

但我们遇到了一点小问题。

Because.

因为

We did like this.

我们确实喜欢这个。

And so.

而且如此。

In a last ditch attempt to really try and drum up business we decided to move the whole company engineers and all.

在最后的努力中，我们决定调动整个公司的工程师和所有的人。

 \[00:09:31\] There was four of us at the time on two sales.

[00：09：31]当时我们有四个人在进行两次销售。

Now it turned out that all of our customers were in the UK.

现在我们所有的客户都在英国。

So what I meant was waking up really early in the morning every day to cold call in the UK a list of local football team managers that we found on the internet.

所以我的意思是每天一大早起床，在英国打电话，上面是我们在网上找到的当地足球队经理的名单。

I used to remember when Matt used to come into my room at 5:00 in the morning every morning.

我记得马特每天早上5点来我的房间。

To start the day\'s calling.

开始一天的工作。

It turns out that 5a.m.

原来是早上5点。

San Francisco time is the perfect time to catch.

旧金山时间是赶上的最佳时机。

A football manager going into the pub.

一个足球经理走进酒吧。

It also turns out that the only thing that they had in common was that they had no idea how we got their numbers.

事实也证明，他们唯一的共同点就是不知道我们是如何得到他们的数字的。

Needless to say we didn\'t have much access says.

不用说，我们没有多少渠道，“他说。

 \[00:10:22\] So in a last ditch attempt to salvage something from the situation.

[00：10：22]所以在最后一条沟里，试图从这种情况中挽救一些东西。

We decided to pivot the business.

我们决定把生意转起来。

And become go cardless.

变得没有卡。

Now we got lucky because a lot of the work that we\'ve done.

现在我们很幸运，因为我们已经做了很多工作。

For group pay turned out to be exactly what you would do.

对集体工资来说，这正是你想要做的。

 \[00:10:39\] To Stocco hardness.

[00：10：39]至Stocco硬度。

We\'d learnt about payments we\'d gone and got a banking deal and we were applying for our regulatory approval.

我们已经了解了付款的情况，并达成了一项银行交易，我们正在申请监管机构的批准。

But what if we hadn\'t started go cardless if we\'d have wanted to do something else.

但是，如果我们没有开始没有卡，如果我们想做其他的事情。

I often think what went wrong in those days angry pay hey it\'s really easy to come up with various reasons why it didn\'t work out.

我经常想，那些日子里出了什么问题，愤怒的付出，嘿，很容易想出各种原因，为什么它不成功。

But if I\'m going to be honest.

但如果我要诚实的话。

I think the reason it didn\'t work was because we weren\'t really building something for ourselves.

我认为它不起作用的原因是我们没有真正为自己创造一些东西。

We weren\'t even building something for our friends and family.

我们甚至没有为我们的朋友和家人建造什么东西。

We come up with this idea on a whiteboard and we thought how theoretically great it could be and we were building a solution for that instead.

我们在白板上提出了这个想法，我们想这在理论上是多么的伟大，我们正在为此建立一个解决方案。

So when it comes to starting your business.

所以当你开始创业的时候。

Beware of those ideas those ideas that seem theoretically really interesting or the ones that are in really big markets.

提防那些理论上看起来非常有趣的想法，或者那些在真正大市场上的想法。

Really ask yourself the question.

问你自己这个问题。

Is this something that I\'d want to use myself.

这是我自己想用的东西吗？

So.

所以

My third lesson.

我的第三课。

 \[00:11:46\] Is about focusing on momentum.

[00：11：46]关注动量。

Now when I first start to go cardless.

现在当我第一次开始无纸化的时候。

I thought that progress would be a fairly linear thing.

我认为这一进展将是一个相当线性的事情。

I thought that we get from the start to success.

我以为我们从一开始就成功了。

Something like this.

就像这样。

But when I think about the story that we\'ve had with go cardless.

但当我想到我们和“无纸化”的故事时。

It couldn\'t be further from the truth.

这离事实再远不过了。

Our story looks something more like this.

我们的故事看起来更像这样。

Now in the early days of Go Hartness.

现在围棋的早期。

We used to spend ages just debating the smallest things.

我们过去常常花很长时间来讨论最小的事情。

We would just.

我们只是。

 \[00:12:31\] Spend hours discussing the smallest of product changes or we agonize over the strategy that we were going to use for capturing this huge vision.

[00：12：31]花几个小时讨论最小的产品变化，或者我们为我们要用来捕捉这个巨大愿景的策略而苦恼。

We had limited time and limited resource and so we thought we can\'t afford to make mistakes.

我们时间有限，资源有限，所以我们认为我们不能犯错误。

We need to make sure that we get it first time round.

我们需要确保我们第一次得到它。

But actually what turned out was that.

但事实证明。

Rather than just you know going in a straight line from start to success.

而不仅仅是你知道，从一开始到成功都是一条直线。

We just spend ages going from A to B and then realizing it was wrong in the end anyway.

我们只是花了很长时间从A到B，然后意识到它最终是错误的。

And so our path just ended up looking like a zigzag but just a much slower one.

所以我们的路径看起来就像一条曲折的路，但速度要慢得多。

This is something that\'s happened so many times I actually struggle to come up with even a specific instance.

这是发生了很多次的事情，我甚至很难想出一个具体的例子。

It\'s like asking what you had for breakfast yesterday.

就像问你昨天早餐吃了什么一样。

You do it so often that you can\'t even remember what you ate yesterday.

你经常这样做，以致于你甚至记不起你昨天吃了什么。

And over time it\'s me.

随着时间的推移，这就是我。

I\'ve realized that.

我已经意识到了。

These mistakes are bound to happen.

这些错误肯定会发生。

You should try and embrace them instead.

你应该试着去拥抱他们。

Instead of agonizing over each and every decision that you make and making sure that you do exactly the right thing.

不要为你所做的每一个决定而烦恼，而要确保你做的是正确的事情。

Is better to get your head down and just run with it.

最好是低下头，跟着它跑。

 \[00:13:47\] And then course correct afterwards instead.

[00：13：47]然后改后改正。

And it\'s through that cycle of just constantly course correcting that you just run really fast and wiggle your way to success.

正是在不断修正课程的循环中，你才会跑得非常快，走上成功的道路。

In the early days especially.

尤其是在早期。

Momentum is the hardest thing to come by.

动力是最难获得的东西。

It\'s way harder than deciding on what idea to do or whether something the right thing or the wrong thing is actually just going from a standstill to something at all.

这比决定该做什么、做正确的事情还是做错的事情更困难。

So I\'d say it\'s better to start doing the wrong thing than to not start at all.

所以我会说，开始做错事总比什么都不做要好。

My last lesson.

我的最后一课。

Is about being an emotional cockroach.

是关于做一只情绪化的蟑螂。

When I told people about this they said what does that mean.

当我告诉人们这件事时，他们说那是什么意思。

So I\'ll explain.

所以我会解释的。

First otherwise I just confuse you.

首先，否则我就把你搞糊涂了。

A cockroach is well-known for being able to withstand a nuclear attack.

蟑螂以能够抵御核攻击而闻名.

And that\'s what I mean.

这就是我的意思。

You need to have emotions that can withstand the biggest of ups and the biggest of downs.

你需要有能够承受最大起起落落的情绪。

I remember when we were doing Y Combinator Brian today from SBM Bay came and gave a talk.

我记得今天我们做Y组合的时候，来自SBM Bay的布莱恩来做了一次演讲。

They told us about the first thousand days of starting their business.

他们告诉我们他们创业的头一千天。

And I remember walking through away from that talk and thinking wow they came so close to financial ruin and it took them so long to see any success.

我记得我从那次谈话中走出来，想，哇，他们几乎要破产了，他们花了很长时间才看到任何成功。

How did they have the courage to do that.

他们是怎么有勇气这么做的。

We hit our financial low a little bit earlier in the summer.

我们在夏天早些时候跌到了我们的财务低谷。

That\'s my co-founder Tom.

那是我的联合创始人汤姆。

In his comfortable abode in San Francisco.

在他旧金山舒适的住所里。

We just moved out there and we didn\'t have anything.

我们刚搬出去，什么都没有。

So Matt on myself took a trip to IKEA to buy the essentials.

所以马特自己去宜家买必需品。

We were really poor by that point.

那时我们真的很穷。

And so we had to be really careful.

所以我们必须非常小心。

We had rations for ourselves.

我们有自己的口粮。

We got there and we had one flimsy mattress each.

我们到了那里，每个人都有一张薄薄的床垫。

One knife.

一把刀。

One fork.

一把叉子。

A plate and then a choice between a mug and a bowl.

一个盘子，然后一个杯子和一个碗之间的选择。

When it came to the checkout.

在结账的时候。

The only way we were able to settle the bill.

我们唯一能结清账单的办法。

Was by splitting it across Mat\'s debit card.

就是把它分给马特的借记卡。

The remains of my overdraft.

我透支的遗骸。

And the absolute dregs of my credit limit.

还有我的信用额度的绝对残渣。

But we just got to Y Combinator.

但我们刚到了Y组合器。

So things were looking up.

所以一切都在好转。

Later that summer.

那年夏天晚些时候。

We\'d.

我们.。

Just been pitching a demo day.

只是做了一天的演示。

And we were starting to think about investment.

我们开始考虑投资。

Now for the last nine months.

在过去的九个月里。

You\'ve got to realize that.

你得意识到这一点。

All of my friends thought I was broke.

我所有的朋友都以为我破产了。

And unemployed.

失业。

So we set ourselves a target.

所以我们给自己设定了一个目标。

We said we will raise a million dollars.

我们说过我们将筹集一百万美元。

If we raise a million dollars then you know it can joke at that right.

如果我们筹到一百万美元，你就知道它可以在这个问题上开玩笑。

I remember talking to a roomful of investors after the demo day pitches and getting really excited.

我记得在演示日之后，我和一屋子的投资者交谈，我感到非常兴奋。

Everyone seemed to be really interested in what we were doing and everyone wanted to find out more.

每个人似乎都对我们正在做的事情很感兴趣，每个人都想知道更多。

We\'d heard all these stories about why some companies closed their rounds in weeks if not days.

我们听说了所有这些关于为什么一些公司几周甚至几天就停业的故事。

And.

和

I thought How hard could it be.

我想这有多难。

We\'re going to close this.

我们要结束这一切。

No problem.

没问题!

We were so excited.

我们太兴奋了。

But then over the coming weeks.

但在接下来的几周里。

The initial eagerness turned into hesitant maybes and eventually definite knows.

最初的渴望变成了犹豫不决的可能，最终确定了答案。

A month and a half later.

一个半月后。

We had raised less than a quarter of what we wanted to and we had been rejected at least 60 times on separate occasions.

我们筹得的钱还不到我们想要的四分之一，而且在不同的场合被拒绝了至少60次。

I remember going to Sand Hill Road.

我记得去沙山路。

We drove there myself and we had a meeting with an investor there.

我们自己开车去了那里，我们在那里会见了一位投资者。

I won\'t name names.

我不会说名字的。

We didn\'t even need to get to the end of the meeting and know that there was the.

我们甚至不需要到会议结束的时候就知道。

This ain\'t never going to happen in the.

这是不可能发生在.。

Yeah sure let\'s keep in touch.

好的，让我们保持联系。

I remember driving back to San Francisco and it felt like one of the lowest points yet.

我记得我开车回旧金山，感觉好像是最低谷之一。

We had to go back to London soon and we were going to go back failures.

我们很快就得回伦敦了，我们要回到失败的境地。

I remember turning to Matt and saying to him.

我记得我转向马特对他说。

Hey how would you feel if I just crashed into this Cyberia here right now laughter.

嘿，如果我刚才撞上这里的赛博亚，你会有什么感觉呢？笑声。

Luckily we both just laughed.

幸运的是我们都笑了。

But then a few weeks later.

It all just seemed to click into place.

所有的一切似乎都已经就位了。

We were back in London.

我们回到了伦敦。

And Tom had been speaking to the guys at Accel.

And all of a sudden almost overnight we\'ve gone from abject failure to smashing our targets and closing around of one point five million dollars.

突然间，我们几乎一夜之间就从惨败变成了粉碎目标，接近150万美元。

I\'d like to be able to say that from that point on it\'s just been smooth sailing.

我想说，从那一刻起，我就一帆风顺了。

But.

但

That would be just a lie.

那只是个谎言。

Every single time you think that you\'re going to get to a certain milestone or achieve the next thing or get to the next level and it will be okay that you know everything will be great.

每一次你认为你会达到某个里程碑，或者达到下一个目标，或者达到一个新的水平，你知道一切都会很棒，这是没有问题的。

But no matter what there\'s always the next challenge these peaks and troughs and never ending.

但无论发生什么\总是下一个挑战，这些高峰和低谷，永远不会结束。

I never appreciated how hard it would be to start a business.

我从来没有意识到创业有多难。

I\'ve had some of the best times of my life working with the guys that go cardless by me also about five times greater than when I started.

我有过一些人生中最美好的时光，和那些在我身边无人问津的人一起工作，也是我开始工作时的五倍。

If it wasn\'t for my co founders and some of the early team and my girlfriend and the friends that supported me I don\'t think I would have made it this far.

如果不是因为我的联合创始人、早期团队的一些成员、我的女朋友和支持我的朋友，我不认为我能做到这一点。

I remember Sam Oatman giving is one of the best pieces of advice that we ever received.

我记得萨姆·奥特曼的献礼是我们收到的最好的建议之一。

He said.

Starting a business is like riding a wave between life and death.

If you can hang on long enough.

如果你能坚持够久的话。

You\'re bound to succeed.
