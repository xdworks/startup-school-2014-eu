**Hiroki Takeuchi-s4RBfIwUBgY.mp4**  \[00:00:03\] Now onto the next speaker.

This afternoon.

 \[00:00:06\] Hiroki is co-founder and CEO of Go club go cardless which is the ukase leading direct debit provider and they now serve more businesses than any other direct debit provider and they\'re also expanding to serve Europe.

Hiroki and his co-founder Matt started go cardless in 2010.

So they\'ve got a fun story to be telling you about their history.

It\'s a really bright eyed pair and I think that\'s a good thing I can kind of barely see the back so I can\'t really see how many people in the room right now.

 \[00:00:49\] Say hi I\'m Hiroki and I start to go cardless actually in the beginning of 2011 with my co-founder is Matt and Tom.

For those of you that don\'t know about what we do basically we make it really easy for businesses to accept recurring payments via direct debit.

When Kate asked me to talk at Startup School she asked me to talk about the early stages of Go cardless and tell our story.

And so when I was thinking through our story I was trying to figure out okay what should I talk about.

And I realized that actually for me the lessons I\'ve learned they didn\'t come from.

Just you specific events so one story here or there the lessons that I learned over time.

And so rather than telling you are straight story I thought I\'d share for lessons that I\'ve learned along the way and then give you some anecdotes as well.

 \[00:01:47\] See if this works.

Okay.

So.

Our first story.

Is about.

When your journey starts actually that your journey starts way earlier than you think.

 \[00:02:01\] When I sat down to really think about this talk and start thinking about what\'s the story of Go cardless and where did it begin.

Actually turned out to be a pretty non-trivial question.

Was it when we wrote our first line of code.

Or was it when Matt Tom and myself agreed to start a business together.

Or perhaps it was when.

Matt and I met for the first time when we shared our dreams of starting a business one day.

 \[00:02:31\] But then I realized that for me my story began way earlier than that.

My story began in the first week of university.

I\'d go to university and know like most people you meet lots of new friends you try out new activities and take up new hobbies.

It was during then that I met a guy called Carreau.

He was in the year above me and he did maths too.

And.

He kind of took me under his wing and in one of those first weeks he took me to meet up for this society called Oxford entrepreneurs.

Basically it was a Students Society that was there to promote entrepreneurship.

And.

I remember my eyes being open for the first time.

This world of startups and business.

Before that I had no idea what it was about.

I thought business was like Lex Luthor andMr.

Burns.

And.

So I remember going to this event and meeting all these really cool people that were interested in taking this other path.

And it was there that I met Corvair and Harge going to kill me when they see this picture because an awful picture of them.

But.

They were the first people that I met that had started a business.

Now you gotta remember back in the you know 2005 2006 when they started their business.

No one was doing that in London everyone was going into banking or law.

And these guys decided to quit their jobs and start a business together and pursue their dreams and I found that fascinating.

So when they decided to move out to San Francisco.

I knew that I needed to persuade them to give me an internship.

In the summer of 2007 those guys finally relented and said Okay cool.

Come and join us for the summer.

And when I got there it turns out that they\'d actually teamed up with a guy called Patrick who\'s actually on stage earlier and they started automatic together.

It was basically an inventory management tool for eBay power sellers.

That\'s them at a conference with them.

I like being on top T.

It was on top of auctions that is.

And.

I got to see firsthand what it was like to be in the earlier stages of being in a startup.

I remember getting that.

And we spent two months living and working out of this tiny apartment in San Francisco.

It was a two bedroom place and there were six of us.

We had three air mattresses between us and we had to sleep in shifts so that we wouldn\'t knock into each other in the night.

That summer I spent the time my time just doing customer interviews.

Testing out the product by selling lasers that we imported from China.

They were so powerful that you could hit a aeroplane out in the sky with them.

I remember this one time we did it and we thought we were going to get caught by the police.

And.

I also was surrounded by all of these developers and learn about what coding was.

Before that I\'d never really been exposed to it.

I also got a chance to go to Y Combinator and see what those dinners were like and I heard some of the stories from founders back then.

So.

When it came to starting my business.

I realized that I learned so much from my experiences.

Automatic.

When I first met Matt would we have had a debate about the pros and cons of.

Cofounders versus starting a business on your own.

Or.

When it came to starting and building our first product.

Would I have learnt the value of coding.

 \[00:06:19\] Would I have even applied for Y Combinator had it not been for the experiences that I had then.

I\'m not sure we would have.

So remember that your journey starts way before you think it does.

And.

If you want to start a business one day.

Then think about what you can be doing right now to learn about what you what you\'ll be doing in the future because you never know what\'s going to be useful.

So.

My second story lesson is about.

 \[00:06:53\] Being careful of white board ideas.

I\'ll explain what I mean by that.

When I met Matt for the first time it was when we first started it was our first jobs out of university and we were working as management consultants for our sins.

 \[00:07:10\] And we quickly realized that we had a shared interest in starting a business.

Maybe one day we\'d want to start a business together.

I remember we used to spend hours in between projects and on the weekends.

Just toying with ideas bouncing around on boards concocting plans of what we might be able to start one day.

I also remember that we had this really terrible pattern where every time we came up with an idea we then spend the next week or few days just tearing it apart and realizing how terrible an idea it was.

 \[00:07:43\] This was all done on a whiteboard.

So when it came to leaving our jobs and we decided that we were going to take the plunge and start a business we still don\'t actually have.

An idea of what we wanted to do.

We hadn\'t settled on something we were excited about.

And now it turns out that actually.

Doing that and telling your friends that you\'re starting a business but you don\'t know what it is yet is a really great forcing mechanism.

We quickly joined forces with Tom and decided to start something called Green Day.

This is one of my early designs and.

The idea is this.

If you or a football captain of your local team or you going on holiday with your friends.

Then.

Collecting money for those informal situations is a real pain.

So we wanted to start something to fix that.

I\'m going to fast forward a little bit now and the story in this is six months later we were out in Silicon Valley and we were working out of an apartment in the mission.

We were on Y Combinator and we had a prototype of this product that we were trying to get anyone and everyone to use.

We were quickly approaching Demo Day which is the culmination of the Y Combinator program.

It\'s when all of the founders of Y Combinator get into a room and present this to a room full of the who\'s who of investors in Silicon Valley.

But we had a little bit of a problem.

Because.

We did like this.

And so.

In a last ditch attempt to really try and drum up business we decided to move the whole company engineers and all.

 \[00:09:31\] There was four of us at the time on two sales.

Now it turned out that all of our customers were in the UK.

So what I meant was waking up really early in the morning every day to cold call in the UK a list of local football team managers that we found on the internet.

I used to remember when Matt used to come into my room at 5:00 in the morning every morning.

To start the day\'s calling.

It turns out that 5a.m.

San Francisco time is the perfect time to catch.

A football manager going into the pub.

It also turns out that the only thing that they had in common was that they had no idea how we got their numbers.

Needless to say we didn\'t have much access says.

 \[00:10:22\] So in a last ditch attempt to salvage something from the situation.

We decided to pivot the business.

And become go cardless.

Now we got lucky because a lot of the work that we\'ve done.

For group pay turned out to be exactly what you would do.

 \[00:10:39\] To Stocco hardness.

We\'d learnt about payments we\'d gone and got a banking deal and we were applying for our regulatory approval.

But what if we hadn\'t started go cardless if we\'d have wanted to do something else.

I often think what went wrong in those days angry pay hey it\'s really easy to come up with various reasons why it didn\'t work out.

But if I\'m going to be honest.

I think the reason it didn\'t work was because we weren\'t really building something for ourselves.

We weren\'t even building something for our friends and family.

We come up with this idea on a whiteboard and we thought how theoretically great it could be and we were building a solution for that instead.

So when it comes to starting your business.

Beware of those ideas those ideas that seem theoretically really interesting or the ones that are in really big markets.

Really ask yourself the question.

Is this something that I\'d want to use myself.

So.

My third lesson.

 \[00:11:46\] Is about focusing on momentum.

Now when I first start to go cardless.

I thought that progress would be a fairly linear thing.

I thought that we get from the start to success.

Something like this.

But when I think about the story that we\'ve had with go cardless.

It couldn\'t be further from the truth.

Our story looks something more like this.

Now in the early days of Go Hartness.

We used to spend ages just debating the smallest things.

We would just.

 \[00:12:31\] Spend hours discussing the smallest of product changes or we agonize over the strategy that we were going to use for capturing this huge vision.

We had limited time and limited resource and so we thought we can\'t afford to make mistakes.

We need to make sure that we get it first time round.

But actually what turned out was that.

Rather than just you know going in a straight line from start to success.

We just spend ages going from A to B and then realizing it was wrong in the end anyway.

And so our path just ended up looking like a zigzag but just a much slower one.

This is something that\'s happened so many times I actually struggle to come up with even a specific instance.

It\'s like asking what you had for breakfast yesterday.

You do it so often that you can\'t even remember what you ate yesterday.

And over time it\'s me.

I\'ve realized that.

These mistakes are bound to happen.

You should try and embrace them instead.

Instead of agonizing over each and every decision that you make and making sure that you do exactly the right thing.

Is better to get your head down and just run with it.

 \[00:13:47\] And then course correct afterwards instead.

And it\'s through that cycle of just constantly course correcting that you just run really fast and wiggle your way to success.

In the early days especially.

Momentum is the hardest thing to come by.

It\'s way harder than deciding on what idea to do or whether something the right thing or the wrong thing is actually just going from a standstill to something at all.

So I\'d say it\'s better to start doing the wrong thing than to not start at all.

My last lesson.

Is about being an emotional cockroach.

When I told people about this they said what does that mean.

So I\'ll explain.

First otherwise I just confuse you.

A cockroach is well-known for being able to withstand a nuclear attack.

And that\'s what I mean.

You need to have emotions that can withstand the biggest of ups and the biggest of downs.

I remember when we were doing Y Combinator Brian today from SBM Bay came and gave a talk.

They told us about the first thousand days of starting their business.

And I remember walking through away from that talk and thinking wow they came so close to financial ruin and it took them so long to see any success.

How did they have the courage to do that.

We hit our financial low a little bit earlier in the summer.

That\'s my co-founder Tom.

In his comfortable abode in San Francisco.

We just moved out there and we didn\'t have anything.

So Matt on myself took a trip to IKEA to buy the essentials.

We were really poor by that point.

And so we had to be really careful.

We had rations for ourselves.

We got there and we had one flimsy mattress each.

One knife.

One fork.

A plate and then a choice between a mug and a bowl.

When it came to the checkout.

The only way we were able to settle the bill.

Was by splitting it across Mat\'s debit card.

The remains of my overdraft.

And the absolute dregs of my credit limit.

But we just got to Y Combinator.

So things were looking up.

Later that summer.

We\'d.

Just been pitching a demo day.

And we were starting to think about investment.

Now for the last nine months.

You\'ve got to realize that.

All of my friends thought I was broke.

And unemployed.

So we set ourselves a target.

We said we will raise a million dollars.

If we raise a million dollars then you know it can joke at that right.

I remember talking to a roomful of investors after the demo day pitches and getting really excited.

Everyone seemed to be really interested in what we were doing and everyone wanted to find out more.

We\'d heard all these stories about why some companies closed their rounds in weeks if not days.

And.

I thought How hard could it be.

We\'re going to close this.

No problem.

We were so excited.

But then over the coming weeks.

The initial eagerness turned into hesitant maybes and eventually definite knows.

A month and a half later.

We had raised less than a quarter of what we wanted to and we had been rejected at least 60 times on separate occasions.

I remember going to Sand Hill Road.

We drove there myself and we had a meeting with an investor there.

I won\'t name names.

We didn\'t even need to get to the end of the meeting and know that there was the.

This ain\'t never going to happen in the.

Yeah sure let\'s keep in touch.

I remember driving back to San Francisco and it felt like one of the lowest points yet.

We had to go back to London soon and we were going to go back failures.

I remember turning to Matt and saying to him.

Hey how would you feel if I just crashed into this Cyberia here right now laughter.

Luckily we both just laughed.

But then a few weeks later.

It all just seemed to click into place.

We were back in London.

And Tom had been speaking to the guys at Accel.

And we\'d also been introduced to another phone call Paschen capital.

We had a final meeting with the partners at Accel.

And I remember getting the call.

And we all huddled around and Adam from Accel told us that they wanted to put in 600K.

The next day.

Passion\'s told us they want to put in 400 K2.

And all of a sudden almost overnight we\'ve gone from abject failure to smashing our targets and closing around of one point five million dollars.

I\'d like to be able to say that from that point on it\'s just been smooth sailing.

But.

That would be just a lie.

Every single time you think that you\'re going to get to a certain milestone or achieve the next thing or get to the next level and it will be okay that you know everything will be great.

But no matter what there\'s always the next challenge these peaks and troughs and never ending.

I never appreciated how hard it would be to start a business.

I\'ve had some of the best times of my life working with the guys that go cardless by me also about five times greater than when I started.

If it wasn\'t for my co founders and some of the early team and my girlfriend and the friends that supported me I don\'t think I would have made it this far.

I remember Sam Oatman giving is one of the best pieces of advice that we ever received.

He said.

Starting a business is like riding a wave between life and death.

If you can hang on long enough.

You\'re bound to succeed.

It turns out that holding onto that wave is one of the hardest things you\'ll ever do.

But.

If you\'re an emotional cockroach you can do it.

It will be one of the best journeys you ever take on your life.

Thank you.

 \[00:20:24\] Applause.
