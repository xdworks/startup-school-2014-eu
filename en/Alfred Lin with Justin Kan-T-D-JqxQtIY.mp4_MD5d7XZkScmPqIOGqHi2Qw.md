**Alfred Lin with Justin Kan-T-D-JqxQtIY.mp4**  \[00:00:02\] Next up I\'m pleased to introduce Alfred Lynn who\'s a partner at Sequoia Capital One of the top investors in Silicon Valley and the world.

He serves as a director on a bunch of awesome Silicon Valley companies like Airbnb Inbee and house.

And before that he was the CFO of Zappos.

Worked in startups for a long time.

So we\'ll have a chat.

Over here.

 \[00:00:37\] Thanks Justin.

Thanks for having me.

All right cool.

Thanks for being here.

So.

Let\'s just start off in the early days and tell us like how you got started with your first startup at an exchange.

 \[00:00:51\] So I knew Tony and Sandra in college.

And originally Tony.

So I came out to the Bay Area one year before Tony.

He had originally wanted to scope out a place on campus at Stanford to open up a Subway\'s franchise because he was always into food.

Before that he and I had met through his pizza business and I told him I\'m sorry there\'s already one on University Avenue happened to be a half mile away from the university but the union and at the time the university would not allow commercial entities to be on campus.

I said you know what.

When you come out you\'re going to have to do something else.

So he and Sanjay came out to the Bay Area.

They were working for Oracle and they were extremely bored so they started a company on their side.

 \[00:01:43\] Building Web sites and they had built these Web sites.

They had put their hearts and souls into making them beautiful at the time.

This is 1996 97 so now a lot of people knew how to code an HMO.

And they were solving a problem that a lot of people wanted a website because the Web was coming up to speed and they built these great websites.

But there was no traffic.

So they like GS spent all this time on this.

And so how do we get these Web sites to get traffic.

And one of if you had Bhoja you can go.

Buy advertising on Yahoo or AOL Amazon at that time.

But if you\'re a small Web site how do you get traffic and that\'s the problem that they.

Experience and the problem that they went out solving and so they left these websites together.

And so.

That became like an interesting thing and they link them so that if you showed a banner on your site you\'d get to show a banner somewhere else on the network and as the network grew the network became more and more powerful because of network effects.

And we had some pretty interesting companies that were part of that network.

And when we sold the company to Microsoft it arguably had the largest audience on the web at the time.

 \[00:02:55\] How did we get you to join an exchange that was the conversation.

What were you doing.

Well I was.

 \[00:03:02\] I was in a PHC program and statistics.

And as Tony would like to say that\'s like watching paint dry on the wall in the dark.

Laughter.

 \[00:03:14\] And look I love numbers and I and I really enjoyed what I was studying.

But I did have a passion for business.

And my parents being very traditional Asian parents had this hierarchy of jobs that you can get one the highest.

Type of job you can do is to be a scholar and contribute to society.

 \[00:03:33\] Then if you can\'t do that then be a doctor and then if you can\'t do that be a lawyer if you can\'t do that be an engineer and all the way down on the list is to be in business.

It was a hard conversation with my parents for me to leave myPh.D.

program but I know Antonians Aunger for a long time and there were people that I bonded with in college and so they needed someone who could work on the finance side.

And I told them I had no experience in finance but I\'m happy to learn.

 \[00:04:02\] I\'m good with numbers and I became finance and Link Exchange.

 \[00:04:08\] And how did you guys in the early days give your initial customers like what was that when you decide to do an exchange.

What was the process like to actually build it into big company.

 \[00:04:16\] Well so they had a net.

They had an initial Web sites that they had already built.

That was part of the sort of thing that basically pivoted their way.

It was a nice little side business by being able to charge per hour to create these Web sites whereas not very scalable and then decided you know what we\'re get for all this money we can forego all of that and we\'re going to just try to get people to join that network and back.

And there is this directory called Yahoo.

So they went down to some of these Web sites that were very popular and reached the popular ranks in Yahoo.

And they just contacted them and asked them Would you like more promotion.

And of course everybody would say yes.

And they joined the network up more and more powerful and it got easier and easier to sell the next company to join because of network effects your arguably better off joining leik exchange.

You know after that the last person joined.

And so one of the more interesting things is.

The one of the very early.

People who joined was a company called Auction Web.

Nobody probably ever heard of AuctionWatch but if you go to Wikipedia and look up eBay you\'ll see in the very early days their original name was AuctionWatch.

So even companies like eBay need a promotion.

Back then of course they\'re worth 65 billion dollars and we were only able to sell the company for 265 no and so.

They had a much better business.

 \[00:05:49\] How did how did you guys end up having that conversation about selling the company wants you.

You have this business that was generating revenue and.

How do you decide what you wanted to do with it.

 \[00:05:59\] Thank you is our first company we had.

Tony has been very public about this in his book.

We had hired people that were.

In it to basically let\'s call it murse mercenaries.

They wanted to sort of.

Join the company because it was a rocket ship.

The metrics looked exponential from the growth perspective and they were trying to build enough business so they can monetize.

The.

Company.

And.

Day by day went by and the place became less and less fun.

To work at.

And we had decided that you know what this is our first company and it was a good offer and we decide to sell the company.

And arguably we sold the company to too early and.

 \[00:06:49\] It was a difficult decision but I think everybody was pretty happy after the fact because we all got to do what we wanted to do.

Tony and I started at the very early days of the startup was a lot of fun.

So we after we sold the company to Microsoft.

We left and started a small Angel Fund called Venture Frogs in 1999.

Probably the worst time ever to start a fund.

Right before the dot com crash.

 \[00:07:14\] But you know we got I wouldn\'t say that we were smart we just got lucky because we invest in some pretty amazing companies like Astley\'s and Open Table and a few others that got sold pretty quickly in 1999 2000 and then we made 27 investments.

We went through a fund we were supposed to invest that fund over a two or three years.

We invested then and I think in nine months another not such great idea.

 \[00:07:45\] But we were left in 2000 2001 with basically a portfolio of 20 companies seven of them.

We thought we were going to war sold or we\'re going to do fine without us.

And then we looked at the 20 and we ourselves or most of these are going to do well or not to world despite our help.

We\'re going to focus on two companies.

One was tell me what works and the other was Zappos.

They.

Spent some time at tell me now works at the time the company was losing.

When I joined asV.P.

of finance they were losing.

Gosh I think about 60 million dollars a year.

They had just come off 1999 where they had been able to raise two hundred and sixty five million.

It was the first time I thought well most most companies learn how to pivot and deal with things when they have so little money.

And this is the first time when I saw a company that actually raise so much money that it was a bad thing.

And I didn\'t know that that could be a bad thing until I saw how much money you can blow because everything was just not worth your time anymore because you had so much money in the company and it\'s not the discipline of this that.

Necessarily the CEO of the management team it\'s it becomes ingrained in the company is like well we have this amount of money in the bank should we just.

Use that money to experiment versus being thoughtful about where you want to spend and invest your comfort your company\'s money.

So what habitant tell me how did you.

 \[00:09:16\] Turn this ship around.

We became very very focused.

The company had been focused on a consumer business suite pivoted city enterprise selling it and tell me for those who you don\'t know what was originally started as a voice portal as a voice recognition portal so you would call 1 800 5 4 5 tell and you can ask at any question.

We pivoted to the enterprise and we started to automate using voice recognition 1 800 numbers and it was arguably one of the first SAS company\'s cloud companies in the world.

We had to build our own recognition servers and put in the cloud.

And so we got very focused on the Enterprise very very focused on a few select customers not trying to.

Get any customer that we could sign up.

 \[00:10:06\] We were very very targeted on 12 to 24 customers and making sure that those were large contracts and very very multi-year successful engagements.

And then one when when I left the company to join Zappos we basically went from zero revenues to about 150 million dollars and recurring revenue and pretty stable cash generating business and was.

Later sold to Microsoft for eight hundred million dollars or so.

So pretty successful.

Seem to work out.

 \[00:10:42\] Fine.

How did you so at the same time you guys threw Venture Frogs had funded Zappos.

So how did you.

 \[00:10:51\] Why did you fund that fund them.

Well Zappos found us and it was next winner who is the founder left a voicemail which we almost deleted.

I think Tony had his hand on his finger on the delete button of the voicemail because he started saying I have this crazy idea.

I want to sell shoes on the internet.

I know nobody would want to buy it on the Internet because people have to try on shoes.

But.

Then.

 \[00:11:16\] If you had deleted it you wouldn\'t have heard that but.

But the shoe business is a 40 billion dollar business and five percent of it or 2 billion was already being done on militar.

Now.

That.

The investment thesis that the Internet was going to be bigger than mail order carried the company it was consistent all the way through the company.

I\'m not saying the company didn\'t have to pivot or had lots of struggles they had tons of that but we got that right.

And.

 \[00:11:45\] Nick got that right.

Which was the.

Which was key and allow the company to focus on.

Building a business that people thought couldn\'t.

Be done.

And I think that\'s actually great that you see founders build businesses that logically should exist but people don\'t think that it can because.

You know if logically it should exist and you solve a real need that people want that service or that product and if people think it can\'t be made it can\'t be done or can\'t be made or can\'t for whatever reason exist.

Then you have a situation where you don\'t have a lot of competition in the very early days where you do need to pivot where you do need to learn and where you need to figure out you\'re standing in the marketplace.

And that was a very powerful proposition for Zappos and another powerful thing for Zappos.

It was a bit of a.

Blessing mostly a blessing but also a curse was that Zappos could never raise a lot of money.

And at Zappos had to figure out how to generate revenue and be proper and do it profitably relatively early.

Soon after you guys investors there was really hard to raise money.

 \[00:13:00\] Yeah.

You know originally we thought you know we\'ll put 500000 dollars and then we\'ll just.

 \[00:13:07\] Hit the next milestone we\'ll put another 500000 dollars and eventually we\'re 2 million dollars into the company.

Nobody really wanted to fund it in 2000 2001.

So we had to keep going and as Tony has written in his book he sold his apartment a few of his apartments that he had acquired after.

Link Exchange was sold to sort of put more money in the company.

And so it was a long road of doing things person making personal sacrifices employees taking less salary than they would like.

But it all eventually worked out.

But it was a.

Painful process through all of that.

Were there.

Were times when you were.

 \[00:13:51\] Ready to throw in the towel and say look this is not going to happen.

 \[00:13:55\] I don\'t think we wanted to throw in the towel.

I just we just didn\'t understand why people didn\'t see the world the way we saw the world.

And we kind of thought well.

 \[00:14:06\] It\'s a pretty big market out there just in the United States.

Why when people backed us and you know there are reasons why people in Baccus backed them right there.

There are lots of e-commerce companies in 1999 2000 2001 that raise a ton of money and then blew it all in customer acquisition.

And these were smart people.

And I think some of the Struth thinking was good and some of the thinking was not so good.

But you know the thing that people did was they sort of calculate the lifetime value on a small base of customers and figured out how much they can spend on marketing and they spend you know basically lifetime value minus a penny a dollar or whatever it is and there is no margin for error.

 \[00:14:50\] And if you model things it doesn\'t always work out like the model says.

And secondly your early adopters are probably that long term value of your earlier doctors are probably higher than the later adopters and people who had not taken that into account.

And so companies that raise 25 50 100 million dollars and in some cases billions of dollars came and gone in the e-commerce space.

So what we did was we tried to be profitable in the first order which was which was not heard of.

 \[00:15:22\] Back then it\'s hadn\'t heard of now.

 \[00:15:27\] How did you mean were the things that you like learned and you should be informed what you were doing.

 \[00:15:33\] I think that the thing that we learned at Link Exchange was that we wanted to build a company that was very very much focused on having a great culture.

And so at Zappos we decided they were going to focus on making sure that the culture is part of the everyday sort of operating principles.

And I think a lot of companies start out with great cultures and eventually they end up not having great cultures because you don\'t focus on it.

You focus on your day to day things that you\'re supposed to do and.

You forget that the culture is only good if you invest in it.

And I just point out to people when they come to when they were taking tours as opposed to the time you know how does this place remain.

 \[00:16:18\] Focused on culture day in and day out when it gets to be big and it\'s just it\'s like a daily habit.

I think the thing that customer culture and customer service and fitness and staying healthy all have in common is.

 \[00:16:33\] You can try to do it in upswings and downswings but if you don\'t make it a daily habit and focus on it on a daily basis it\'s not going to really be your your core competency.

 \[00:16:42\] And if you want customer service or or anything or your culture or anything else to be a core competency you have to focus on on a daily basis.

 \[00:16:51\] So you went from being investments up to joining as an operator how to how to be.

How did that conversation you how do you decide.

That.

You need to do that.

 \[00:17:03\] Well I think there was.

 \[00:17:04\] Tony had joined early on as an adviser.

And then eventually full time and then eventually big.

NEC decided Tony should be CEO and I had finished finish up my tour at Tell Me and.

There was one company we thought we could make.

Great and you know we had basically Venture Frogs was was.

 \[00:17:32\] Money front friends a family of ours and we wanted to make sure that even those in 1999 fund and lot of angel funds or venture funds decided that they could take a big write off for that year.

We decided that was not going to be the case.

We at least had to make sure that we provided.

Capital back if not a good return.

We wanted to make sure that we provide a good return and wanted to.

So basically it was something that.

 \[00:17:57\] I felt personally responsible and compelled to to make sure was successful.

 \[00:18:03\] You know.

Tell me tell me was a very interesting experience where they had too much money.

It was overcapitalized.

And I would say Zappos was another story where they were undercapitalised for a long period time.

There are very few e-commerce companies that have been built with less than Tamilians a primary equity invested in it.

Zappos had only about 10 million hours of primary equity invested and then.

HadU.S.

debt and a revolving line of credit to build its business borrowed from their merchants sister continued to build its business and it was.

 \[00:18:39\] Very scary sometimes because leverage is great on the upside it also can kill you on the downside.

 \[00:18:47\] What was the scariest moment.

 \[00:18:50\] There are a lot of scary moments I think enduring Link Exchange we almost missed payroll a few times.

That sort of hardens you once you have to go through that once or twice or three times.

My time was the tenth time you just kind of said alright we\'ll figure it out.

And so Zappos had many of those challenges too before I joined.

When I you know I had.

Just gotten married and had.

 \[00:19:17\] Just basically SIRF convinced my wife that we\'re gonna go move from San Francisco to Las Vegas where they where Zappos had moved to.

And then Tony tells me that we had this revolving line of credit.

It had temporarily been increased from three or 40 million.

We had we had to use all.

40 million of it at the time but because of a glitch in an algorithm of a markdown mark up process we had.

Sort of.

Over ordered.

 \[00:19:49\] A bunch of stuff and we had to sort of mark that down.

And so therefore we\'re going to take a loss this quarter which would.

I\'m like listening to all this might come on what\'s what\'s the big deal which was going to cause us to break one of our bank covenants.

And I\'m like thinking.

 \[00:20:07\] What did I just do I just quit my last job.

I had convinced my wife to win in Vegas.

We\'re just sold our house.

And.

Then we\'re going to pack up.

So I heard that as soon as I heard that it got on the phone we just figured we\'d just try to figure out how to.

So we had to find 10 million dollars because the line was going from.

40 to 30 million dollars in about a month and we had to find ten dollars to reduce our debt by ten dollars and make all the payments.

And not missed payroll and things like that was pretty.

 \[00:20:45\] Heron\'s you know.

But we got through it.

I think you know once you get through it once or twice you know that you can get through it again.

You know 19.

1999 2000 was a very interesting time there was a lot of ups and then 2000 2001 was a lot of downs.

 \[00:21:04\] I think 2005 and 2006 were starting to get out of those downs for a lot of e-commerce companies and then 2008 2009 there was a lot of downs.

 \[00:21:15\] I think this you just have to as Hiroki said you have to be an emotional story of rock and be able to absorb these shocks the system.

And if you can do that you can persisting continue to go on was Zappos growing the whole time with these times and ups and downs as opposed is crying throughout this time.

But it was growing in it in an inconsistent rate.

And I think the hardest part about.

Startups is the plan for what\'s going to happen.

You think if you\'re building a product the great thing about software today is if you\'re building a software product it\'s in a cloud you can provision perfectly and anything that requires hardware that requires inventory it requires servers provisioning spaceetc.

If you\'re off you can be you can be significantly off because.

Compounding works in mysterious ways and you can be off a lot and if you bought too much and you\'re off.

Then you\'re.

You have too much inventory you bought too little and you\'re off.

You may miss out a bunch of sales missing on a bunch of sales is not as bad as being laden with a bunch of inventory.

It\'s not good either.

 \[00:22:32\] Either.

So what are some of the most innovative things that you think you did at Zappos that really kind of made the company what it was.

Talking about the culture we\'re talking about things in ways that you were.

 \[00:22:46\] I think the culture is very important.

I think you\'re building a company that was focused on customer service that was very important.

So focus on customer service one back then nobody really focused on customer service.

If you said to me today I\'m building the Zappos of another category it\'s probably not as interesting but if you come up if you solve a hard problem and make that your core competency I think that\'s a very very important lesson because.

First of all hopefully that problem you\'ve lived and you\'re personally passionate about and you\'re solving it.

That\'s probably because.

There are other people who face that problem and make that a priority in their lives and find value in that.

So we found lots of people missed the fact that stories provided actually good customer service and online online provided not so great customer service and we\'re going to bring that back.

So that was another innovation.

I think the fact that we were running our distribution center and our call center 24/7 was seemingly.

You know today may not seem like.

An innovation but back then it was we had figured out ways of picking.

 \[00:23:52\] When you place an order we would pick pack and ship within four hours whereas other people were batching them the next day and sending it out.

Little things add up.

And so.

We figured out how to get products to people after the order of between five to seven days when we started.

And then eventually we cut that time little by little by little to overnight before we sold the company to Amazon.

So I think those things were all very innovative.

Obviously we had some other technology advantages such as we had a full warehouse that was.

 \[00:24:29\] That every single item we had and license plate unique license plate number assigned to it.

So we knew exactly where it was in inventory so we had close to 100 percent accuracy in inventory management which had not been heard of before and direct to consumer fulfillment.

And so those are some.

 \[00:24:48\] Examples.

So you talked about selling the company how did after surviving all these different ups and downs for years and years how did that conversation come about how you\'d make that decision.

Well Amazon had those actually disclose both Tony\'s book and the recent book about Amazon Amazon had been following the company and.

 \[00:25:10\] Wanted to buy the company for a long period of time.

They had started to compete with us and.

They made an offer that was much more compelling.

 \[00:25:19\] Most most of the time acquisitions what happened you\'d get absorbed by the parent company.

Here is a situation where Still\'s appears today as a separate brand a separate business has a separate culture and a separate location.

And left to the.

The current.

Team there to run as a wholly owned subsidiary but a separate business and that was much more compelling than being absorbed into a mothership.

 \[00:25:46\] What do some of the lessons that you learned about Zappos.

Do you know today that you wish you knew.

In the beginning about supporting startups.

 \[00:25:56\] I think you know a lot of the things we\'ve just talked about.

Yeah.

You want to continue to price progress and not give up on the.

On the.

On your big dream.

You need to sort of maybe make calls and pivot and write off certain thingsetc.

But the courses as people have pointed out here non-linear and pivoting is okay but you don\'t want to give up.

The second thing is.

 \[00:26:21\] You know I think companies that get started by personal passion and solving a personal pain seems to do a lot better than those do not.

Third is those charts that are.

 \[00:26:33\] Sort of exponential growth.

If you do you know in all these talks if you sort of narrow it down to the very early beginnings it looks very very flat.

It takes a long time to get the flywheel going and so don\'t be discouraged if the flywheel hasn\'t gone.

As smoothly as you expected it to go.

But just keep at it keep at it get stronger and stronger every single day.

What do you think the core the core problem that you\'re solving for.

And when you sort of pivot and you think about what the next thing that you\'re trying to do solve a real heart problem that nobody else is solving.

And.

Find a core competency that you can own and you can talk about all the companies you\'ve heard on stage today whether it\'s stri for Homejoy or.

 \[00:27:22\] Go paperless all these companies are trying to solve problems that they had personal pain with and they had to sort of get the flywheel going over a number of trials.

 \[00:27:33\] So now you\'ve move back to the Bay Area to become professional investors again and working at Sequoia.

What.

Would you think.

How do you think companies should ideally try to work with their investors.

What do you think.

Good Vs Veazey does.

 \[00:27:49\] It\'s funny that you ask that question.

Look he\'s been so I\'ve been on both sides and I think it\'s a privilege they\'ve been on both sides.

And I think the reason the reason I joined Sequoia is that you know personally I think it\'s a very special place because most of the partners there have.

Worked at companies start a company has been met been part of the Managed chain of companies that have done pretty extraordinary things.

And we don\'t see ourselves as as investors.

We\'re not looking to buy low sell high.

I think that\'s what you should look for.

In someone who is an investor you want a partner you don\'t want an investor.

And.

That\'s that\'s probably something that I would coach all of you to sort of think about.

The other thing is.

Often pitches are very short.

We\'re trying to assess you.

You\'re trying to assess us.

I would just point out a statistic that you should think about which is you know people date for many years and they get married where they decide to have a partnership whether it\'s it\'s marriage or or.

 \[00:28:59\] Or a business partnership.

And 50 percent of those relationships still end up.

Breaking up or in divorce a break.

So I would spend more time getting to know your investors before you let them and us in your company because if things go well it\'s a 5 10 15 year journey.

So.

My advice.

 \[00:29:23\] To you guys have invested in a very high percentage of some of the top seed companies.

How do.

 \[00:29:30\] You How do you how do you pick the companies that you work with.

 \[00:29:34\] Well look I mean we\'ve been very very fortunate to be in business with Y see for many many years since the very beginning.

And.

I think we try we try to be.

 \[00:29:47\] Try to understand who the founders are.

 \[00:29:49\] Again back to what I said before we\'re looking for people we want to work with for the next 5 10 15 years.

We\'re looking for founders that will not will our unstoppable will not stop and they will figure out ways to get to the next level next level that we\'re looking for.

People who have deep insight into an industry and have asked why and why again.

 \[00:30:13\] And challenge all the assumptions on the whole industry that they\'re trying to disrupt and decide that these are the five things they\'re going to try to do.

Not a hundred things.

These are the five things they\'re going to do to disrupt the industry.

And have a clear sense of what that wedge into that industry would be.

 \[00:30:32\] So we hear the early days of trying to restart stripe or Air B and B or Dropbox.

All of them had very clear reasons why they\'re going to be a destructive destructive force.

In.

 \[00:30:45\] Their particular domain or in their particular industry.

Go.

 \[00:30:50\] Figure running out of time.

So thanks a lot for joining us.

All right.

Thank you.
