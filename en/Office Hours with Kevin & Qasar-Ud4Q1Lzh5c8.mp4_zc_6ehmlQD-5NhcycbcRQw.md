**Office Hours with Kevin & Qasar-Ud4Q1Lzh5c8.mp4**  \[00:00:05\] Hi everyone.

My name\'s Kevin Hower partner at Y Combinator.

I went through see myself back in 2006.

Cofounded a company called Wufu online form builder Rennick company for about five years and was acquired by Survey Monkey back in 2011.

My background is in product development User Experience Design and customer support.

 \[00:00:29\] My name is Casser I\'m also a partner in NYC quick history is I went through icee in winter 11 and we had a company called Hawkman and Tuckman lets consumers send messages to businesses and vice versa.

We were acquired by Google coincidentally on the exact same day as Wufu.

So that\'s an interesting fact for me and Kevin and and I\'ve been a partner here.

My perspective and partner a couple times.

My experience is actually similar to Kevin\'s.

I was a product design is kind of what I\'m what I\'m good at.

All right so time to do some office hours so office hours are a big part of why he is.

And there are kind of four different types of office hours.

There are group office hours in the sense that when you\'re a startup you actually are broken into many groups that we see and Kevin and I have group office hours with small groups every Tuesday and this is the case with all the partners the group OFSAA serve as a way to see what you as a startup are doingvs.

the other startups and in terms of the tempo as you\'re going through I see what you should be working on what problems you\'re facing and you really realize I think as a founder in group office hours that your problems are actually not just unique to you.

They\'re actually very similar to other companies.

Then there\'s individual office hours.

That\'s what we\'re going to try to emulate here.

It\'s individual partners sitting down with companies we do a lot of individual office hours every week hundreds of them.

That is really the heart of kind of office hours and when people are offered office hours that\'s usually what they\'re talking about.

There\'s two other types of office hours worth mentioning.

One is investor office hours so Elford and I actually did office hours and we\'re going to talk.

So investors come to see we pair them up and literally go through you know what the company is in short short meetings.

And then there are what we call like a company office hours so Amazon or Apple come in very tactical things like how do you know problems with the app store or to yes or whatever it might be Rackspace Roku et cetera.

So today we\'re going to do individual OFSAA give you guys a little bit of a peek of what happens at Lycee.

 \[00:02:27\] So these are obviously going be a little bit different than actual office hours.

The ones that we do see they tend to be a lot longer we only have 10 minutes for these startups and we usually have a ton of context because we\'ve been working with these startups over time so people might think that office hours like the way you\'ve probably seen before are like pitches but that is not actually the way we run them.

We already have a lot of understanding of what the startups are working on.

And so usually our officers are very tactical very focused on very solving very specific problems with them.

And so we might not get into that today but you know that\'s how things are gonna be a little bit different.

You know I would have 800 people watching right.

That changes the dynamic a little bit.

The other thing is I want to talk a little bit about sort of like if you get a chance to do office hours are there with your partners or other sort of notable investors.

There are some things that I would highly recommend to you.

So both for the sharks that we\'re about to meet with but also for you guys out there if you go talk to us later today or with other investors down in the future because officers tend to not be like pitches right which is where I would recommend you focus on being concise and clear in regular office hours where you\'re having a relationship with an investor.

What we want to know is very quickly to get to the heart.

So the first thing is like know your numbers.

It\'s very frustrating to us that we\'re talking with a startup and they have we ask questions about sort of like about retention their users and all this stuff and they just don\'t know where they stand and it makes it very difficult for us to sort of diagnose their problems.

The other thing is I come to do office hours with a specific problem in mind.

Investors don\'t really like sitting around and sort of shooting the shit or at least not the good ones right.

So we like to be able to say that like you have something specific some problem that you want identified or solved and then we\'ll brainstorm with you during that or we might have a connection that might be able to help solve that problem for you.

And the last thing is like if you\'re having an office hours with someone and it feels like deja vu from the last time you talked to them or you\'re repeating the same numbers over again still working on the exact same problems.

No that that is a problem to us.

Right.

So try to focus on when you have office hours like you\'ve done a lot of things based on the feedback from beforehand or you have reasons why those things don\'t work and going to us with new sets of problems rather than hashing over the same things over and over again.

All right.

With that let\'s do the deal first company is Zeila fi.

 \[00:04:50\] And I think we have Lauren let\'s give me a round of applause applause applause.

 \[00:04:57\] This is really this is really turning into a variety show.

 \[00:05:00\] He has gone off to do some tricks afterwards.

All right.

So tell us what you do.

 \[00:05:06\] So we either fight we profile high growth exciting small and medium sized companies to leverage their company culture and employer brands as a competitive advantage.

So we build online profiles using our feet to the office.

It is the employees and understanding what it\'s like to work there and to what end to help them attract great talent so talent can self select as well.

So yeah exactly.

 \[00:05:30\] And why do those picks start ups.

I mean they tend to be companies that don\'t have a lot of money to recruit.

 \[00:05:36\] Sure.

So part of the problem was at university obviously you know we focus on the junior level market and the large corporates have such a big employer brand and stock in so many talented graduates.

But all of these small companies that meet great people just don\'t have that employee to live.

So whilst they most they don\'t have a huge budget they do have a great great company culture and they are an attractive place to work.

But for the average joe you could come out of university they don\'t know these companies exist.

 \[00:06:03\] So I mean you know we did start up one of the first things you would see when you see a job board is do you actually.

Are there other companies on there that are relevant.

How do you get kind of these early adopters to actually sign up because the first thing I\'m looking as I don\'t wanna waste my time posting across 15 different sites or what\'s the incentive for that early stage company to actually.

 \[00:06:21\] Sure.

So company culture is quite a popular topic at the moment with companies like Buffa showing how important it is to leverage their company culture.

So as an example they profile their company culture quite widely themselves and on average get 400 applicants per job.

So the impacts of showing your company culture is really valuable.

So actually when we go to chat\'s companies that\'s something they understand quite well.

So from our perspective it\'s just a great way for them to share that.

So this is.

 \[00:06:51\] The way I sort of see it as a straight up sort of market place sort of play.

And whenever we\'re dealing with groups that are creating marketplaces that they have like onesided in the marketplace like sort of solved right with some kind of deep insight or they have something they figured out right so they can focus all their time on the other side of the market.

So where are you guys at right now.

 \[00:07:09\] Sure.

So I think we\'re definitely more focused on the company side.

I think on the supply side and on the supply side you\'re correct on the on the candidate side you know our strategies are just kind of with or without networks leveraging the student student societies on campuses but which one do you feel like you have solved that you focus on the other.

 \[00:07:28\] I think it\'s the companies so actually onboarding companies there\'s been a lot more simple candidates than misconceptions of start ups and seminars with junior level talent is quite large in terms of what they think it would be like what career progression is there so actually solving that side is quite difficult.

But the companies really understand why they want to show off what they want what it\'s therefore and how they can attract talent.

 \[00:07:51\] The thing is like for these types of businesses like signing up companies are usually not that difficult because the companies don\'t pay you what for the first or second or third posting but if there isn\'t traction I think that we say all companies do pay upfront.

Okay.

 \[00:08:03\] Because you convince them that they can we will help highlight your culture quickly and as a student why would I use this job more than any other one.

It seems somewhat more limiting than again the same thing right.

You don\'t want to post across multiple parties.

Sure.

 \[00:08:17\] So obviously you know if your if your if you\'re a university graduate looking at jobs usually just get a standard job and that doesn\'t tell you anything about what the company is like.

So you can get to very similar job but votes.

But actually the companies behind it can be very very different.

So what we do is we as Lawrence said we would go with photos the office of video interviews of the current employees in fresh about the company compromise that you have on the site.

12 at the moment.

Okay.

And how many students have you guys actively placed.

Currently currently does none.

We\'re still the early stage.

We\'ve had we\'ve had can do is go through an interview.

How long have you guys been working on this.

 \[00:08:52\] About six months.

So we went live about a month ago with our company.

So we\'ve just been driving can what do you think going to be the biggest challenge in the next three months in terms of.

 \[00:09:03\] I guess I guess I\'m a bit skeptical that students are just going to rush in to sign up for a job site.

 \[00:09:09\] Yeah exactly and actually we found quite high engagement.

So we had to go through each interview and haven\'t had the results yet but they look through all the different jobs in those two companies that they had about their own user experience.

They were quite interested in that area.

They compared both and came to us and said I didn\'t think I fit in this company but I\'m pretty sure I definitely fit in this one.

So for us it\'s a great way to understand how they\'re looking at it the depth of information and actually to give some context.

 \[00:09:36\] You said you have 12 company profiles you sort of made it feel like right now like your own job is not on board anymore companies like your place.

Some employers obviously the big thing is like what did the student say and like how many students have you program your students have actually gone in and filled out applications at the moment.

 \[00:09:53\] You know there are a lot of vanity Metock I\'d be like how many people are coming to come to the site but as you said I kind of focus is just to get those like a very few small handful of very high quality up gimps and get them through.

 \[00:10:05\] I think what you need to be that\'s like you know I think right now you\'re just trying to figure out what sticks.

Sure.

So like how are you finding even your student how even knowing about you guys.

I feel like you want as many students to be aware of you.

 \[00:10:20\] So yeah I mean currently that party like just targeting your personal networks.

So people are coming to us saying no we need a job what kind of companies have you got.

 \[00:10:29\] And then we can show them the profiles and sort of careers with the end within our season the advantage as well is how did you get the first 12 companies.

So just to pass.

Okay.

How do you how do you want to get the next hundred say.

Well the most recent ti we\'ve got through client recommendations they\'ve said you thought their value is in marketing companies is also raising their awareness so getting that brand out there and that\'s what\'s made them recommenders on.

So that\'s part of what we\'re looking at as well.

And then building in options to share the company and show that sort of viral.

 \[00:11:00\] So beyond the original you know.

So let\'s let\'s go back to the actual applicants beyond your friends and people at your uni.

How are you going to kind of communicate this value proposition because I think saying like oh there\'s great culture in these companies.

 \[00:11:16\] Yes and that\'s more of our pitch towards companies.

 \[00:11:20\] For a lot of graduate students that are to say like looking at the profiles and going like this it\'s like a culture.

Yeah yeah.

What\'s ingredients to culture and how do you differentiate if you have 12 companies that are all that have good culture.

 \[00:11:32\] So it varies I guess you get users looking for what makes people want to stay.

What are the people like you sitting next to.

So rather than just sort of company culture which is the overarching term we use I guess a lot of what we\'re looking at is do you want to sit next that has an everyday context.

 \[00:11:47\] You know what I\'m worried about right now is like you\'ve done a really good job building like a company branding Yelp like service.

Right.

But like that job marketplace.

Yes that\'s right.

And I think right now you\'ve got to talk to more students about like are the pages actually effect like they\'re effective at making the companies feel good about themselves because they feel like well we look pretty lame before these guys can make us look at these sort of landing pages.

Right.

 \[00:12:09\] But like the punchline I mean you don\'t want these companies to be enthusiastic for you just because you came and shot their offices and you did individual sales and founders do sales.

They\'re very effective.

But as you go to the next 100 or 200 companies there is at least to me and this is a shortcut and this is strange because usually we\'d have talk for hours.

It just it\'s it\'s strange too it\'s hard for me to identify a very clear differentiator.

And I think what Kevin is saying is talking to students because I think if a lot of Suyanto companies will show up.

So so what.

You know what is the kind of what\'s going to drive students.

 \[00:12:43\] The other thing I\'m worried about is like culture.

It\'s one of those things that people once they sort of experience the company first hand.

It\'s going to be authentic or not.

It doesn\'t matter what you sort of see on the Web site.

Once they go in there for the job interview resumes are going to know whether that company is Lamira.

It\'s like saying I\'m pretty cool.

Yeah that\'s cool.

What we know.

So you\'re not lying on this.

It\'s one of those things like maybe the focus is like these companies are too lame to make this marketplace sort of take off and the maybe the first companies that you really need sort of help.

Build out this other side of the marketplaces you\'ve got to figure out how do I get these really cool as companies out there whether it\'s offering them services for free right to highlight their stuff and tell their story as early on as possible.

It\'s like the really good companies figure out how to do that for themselves.

The company that have a hard time talking about like how we\'re cool like there were already like going uphill.

 \[00:13:30\] You know in a normal office hours I would say let\'s talk next week after you talk to X number of students and we just validate that or even in those conversation was amazing and forgot.

Look what is actually relevant to students in this audience and we assume that culture is like a super critical thing but maybe to students that just isn\'t and isn\'t a hypothesis that we have that isn\'t really validated by the market.

I think I think it\'s a good example of an idea.

I think it sounds great.

I mean first time you look at your local dissection makes a lot of sense but it\'s a very intellectually seductive and that\'s not a great thing because you actually don\'t know there isn\'t somebody who woke up today and said you know what I\'d really love a job site which highlights you know a company culture so I can choose a company to work at.

And that\'s.

You know that\'s a big fear that you actually build something that people actually don\'t want even though it sounds like something that people would want.

So changing gears just a little bit.

Have you considered it like you actually building this for just regular job seekers in general.

 \[00:14:28\] I mean a focus was the junior job market purely because obviously that\'s the kind of market that we knew and that\'s how we experienced it firsthand in my understanding of junior job market would be like why do hourly employees like the taco bells of the world.

 \[00:14:41\] They need a lot of help.

Is there a reason that you specifically chose kind of start ups other than maybe your own interest.

 \[00:14:48\] Well not even so much just startups I mean it\'s very much the kind of high growth high performing Samis purely for the fact that no graduates come out to university and they just have no idea what else is out there apart from the large professional services firms and they just don\'t seem to want to explore that.

 \[00:15:04\] So yeah I think a lot of it is down to sort of pressure from parents that feel like you\'re just guessing right now.

So we\'ve done we\'ve done research on that side.

 \[00:15:15\] So we had like if they\'re not actively searching out there then the triggers for like getting them to come to your site are going to be difficult.

You have to figure out like how do I change the natural behavior of India like ideal scenario.

 \[00:15:25\] Like you already know there\'s there\'s this latent demand and you\'re you\'re just going to put the hose on it and extract that value.

And so I think what Kevin means is Yeah like maybe actually students only want to go to professional firms or do something else that maybe actually they don\'t want to work for start ups and they don\'t want to work for high growth and B.

 \[00:15:44\] We hope we have evidence that\'s not true.

For example when we did like an office crawl where we had a load of companies we took a group of students around to look inside and we had a number of students who said I was only applying to the structured graduate scheme.

I always only want to look in these small companies.

Yeah I didn\'t I don\'t even know these existed in my own.

 \[00:16:03\] So you\'re saying the biggest Promus education right now.

Yeah exactly.

Are you guys educating students.

Yeah.

Which are you doing that.

 \[00:16:08\] So we\'ve got sort of nonfinancial partnerships with a lot of society say the entrepreneur Saatchi\'s things like that that can be there to give an understanding of what it\'s like to work in these companies.

Running office cross-sell.

We are going to try as far as how many students I talked to through those.

 \[00:16:27\] I mean it\'s kind of been in the hundreds rather than thousands at the moment obviously just ask the two of us.

We\'re trying to be as high as possible.

I mean scaling that is probably going to be one of our biggest challenges.

 \[00:16:39\] I mean you know and then you say you talk to someone so I take that as to be true.

That means if students really do want these types of jobs then it becomes really important for you obviously to communicate on the landing page which is kind of there.

We looked at the language before here.

We would do a separate office on copy and you act on that.

But the the kind of other thing is how do you make sure the companies that get in are not leme because of the companies are getting lame students who are who actually bought that call that action whether they hear from another society maybe they\'re in some professions you actually might have ruined them for.

Yeah but they\'re like well this isn\'t exactly like you know what I envisioned.

 \[00:17:17\] Yeah that\'s very true.

That\'s why you know we are trying to almost have a kind of filtering process of the companies that we work with.

What are the kind of rough so like 15 to 250 employees high growth high performing and kind of people centric.

You know they they do turn away companies.

Yeah.

 \[00:17:35\] Yeah.

I mean it\'s exactly you say well our site is nothing without having quality and we feel very conscious of making sure that especially with the company\'s site.

 \[00:17:46\] And it doesn\'t like if that\'s online and if they\'re making up this company culture that doesn\'t exist then it doesn\'t work for let\'s say if I have a lame startup what I really want to be on your site could not fake this stuff like say I\'m really high growth say I\'m really cool have a cool icon and get on your site and then actually be late again.

How do you actually test that the companies are not lame.

 \[00:18:10\] Yeah I think at the moment it\'s very sort of time intensive on my side so I do a lot of the client side sales and it\'s just understanding how they talk what they discuss looking at their social media accounts looking at their how their previous employee discussed there.

Yeah.

 \[00:18:25\] I mean I think it\'s the right thing to do at this stage.

Again another kind of we could do OFSAA again next week.

The other thing I would say is that the other thing I would say is yeah like it would be good to identify at this stage just a two or three different metrics that you do want to.

Ultimately you want to get to a state where you can say this company and we talk to him in 10 minutes are going to says they should be on here or not.

And the reason.

And how to communicate to other companies that are not on their own why they\'re not on there so they don\'t say when students ask them why are you not on the job board to say like well because we\'re lame and they told us.

 \[00:18:57\] Exactly.

 \[00:18:58\] So we\'re out of time.

Thank you very much.

Just like.

 \[00:19:10\] It is strange doing officers because you on stage because when you\'re when you\'re doing individual officers don\'t bring up the next company Buza as you know when we\'re doing individual office hours.

Aside from the thing that Kevin said it did a lot of context.

You can just I think really get into the nitty gritty like we you know in this case I was kind of dying to actually pull up the site to really talk about if a lot of these value props that they\'re that they\'re they\'re talking about actually show up on the center easily communicated because obviously the founders and Ogleby pitching to startups and companies it\'s that site that has to make that clear.

 \[00:19:44\] Onto the next tushy name and a little bit better start to share.

 \[00:19:49\] I\'m Adara Mazic and I am the founder and CEO of a startup called views fusee is as its a platform trying to make the physical world an easier place to understand.

 \[00:19:58\] And we do this specific what does that mean literally like said a and.

All right.

We are a retailer.

What does that mean to me.

 \[00:20:09\] You\'re a retailer.

We put sensors in your stores.

We detect customers as they move around and we show you what type of sensors we put in Wi-Fi sensors that pick up smartphone signals.

One said multiple sensors multiple sensors in actually and then that it just Wi-Fi which basically.

So they are reconfigured Wi-Fi access points which can then detect the Wi-Fi icicles or smartphones.

 \[00:20:32\] We try to rate people as they move across the water while people who just walk by the Wi-Fi as the Tories problems are right so whatever they walk by the right and actually go in.

 \[00:20:42\] That\'s the biggest problem in our space product wise.

So most of the companies in our space trying to take people using an access point which as you\'ve highlighted you are not able to actually figure out whether a person is inside or outside.

So what we\'ve built is a system that actually is able to tell whether a person is really outside or inside.

This is like.

This is out in the real world.

This is life right now.

How many customers do you have.

We have four customers for customers at four locations or four companies for companies for many locations.

 \[00:21:11\] They\'re in pilot stage about one or two locations each pilot stage that means they\'re paying you or it\'s not yet they\'re all paid.

OK.

So you end there just Wi-Fi access points to as the wife explains everything else.

Is there any other type of sensor quote unquote.

 \[00:21:24\] So we also use for counters 3-D cameras that can pick up and move across the shop.

 \[00:21:29\] I\'ve read all the cool stuff that burying the lead on the course.

Yeah the first thing you see is like we install custom customized Wi-Fi access points out 3-D cameras all this stuff and we track data for retail outlets that has a contract beforehand and we call them and also not to do it yet.

So you don\'t have anyone wants to join your company and pitch is pitching it back to you.

 \[00:21:52\] Okay.

So I think we understand what you do.

So I mean I think it\'s pretty out of the let\'s let\'s.

Why do retailers want this.

 \[00:21:59\] So they don\'t currently do.

Okay so today about let\'s say 43 percent of UK retailers actually track people who move into the stores using their full four counters either a physical one or an actual physical counter of a doorway at the other people tracking.

So those who aren\'t tracking either don\'t see the business benefit yet.

It could be a supermarket where they get maybe 90 something percent of people who walk in converts in any way or could be businesses too small and focused on survival rather than politics.

So your product these four pallets are large locations mid to large size businesses rather than locations even businesses with small locations and lots of them are still valid customers.

 \[00:22:37\] Okay so just large companies that are sophisticated enough to actually digest some of the analytics.

Exactly.

So let\'s talk about the analytics that you give.

What is the what\'s the thing that the retailers want the most.

 \[00:22:46\] The two pieces of information they want the most.

One of those is the percentage of visitors who were outside who are now inside.

And that ties back to theU.S.

we talked about earlier on the second of those is how much time people spend in site.

So the dwell time and the stock PA as we call them and then what can they do with those three pieces of data.

So with the dwell time we see a relationship between the amount of money people spend and the amount of time they spend so much time being money for every 1 percent increase in dwell time you have a one point three percent increase in the actual spend per customer.

That\'s one that\'s great.

The second is Stockham PA.

So if you see if you\'re running a retail store and you get in let\'s say 10000 visitors in on a day you don\'t know if that was 1 percent of passing traffic or 5 percent of Passan traffic.

You\'re not able to optimize and actually increase that.

How do you find these first four.

So we actually went we did we did an accelerator when we first started the acceleration truces as he introduced us to a few different customer groups and we really threw a few things at the wall to see what stuck.

We started out togged and smaller retailers go in for a shorter key inside their smaller retailers.

They just don\'t have time to try to survive.

Their interest and optimize and just want to be around DIMAR.

So we went through this and we discovered that retailers are largest market and they have a need.

The challenge that we found is that they have quite a long sell cycle.

The larger they get.

But that\'s where the real need as well.

So we\'re just working through a cell cycle right now.

 \[00:24:11\] So you guys you run in the pilots.

When is the next step for those pilots.

But they become like customers.

 \[00:24:17\] So the steps are typically six months 36 months to a pilot and then you\'ve got a time after that when they\'re evaluating the product and then they do a rollout.

 \[00:24:26\] It\'s just like I guess you have or your past experience knows this.

 \[00:24:29\] This is base.

I mean this is coming in from other companies who\'ve been in space before so during comments that we\'re in place and so it\'s a mix of what we\'ve learned and what they\'ve done as well.

 \[00:24:37\] What I assume you talk to more than four to get these four pilots the ones that said no what was there like most significant objection.

 \[00:24:44\] So those that have said no.

Some of it\'s because they literally have so much analytics in place already and they just don\'t need anymore.

Some of them one level.

 \[00:24:56\] I mean that\'s going to be worrying right because she\'s visited retailers that means they\'re probably employing a lot of this technology already so that when one definite.

 \[00:25:04\] The thing is like they just don\'t have the kind of brainpower to digest and sort of like analyze it like they just don\'t have time to like bring on data science people to work on that stuff.

So that\'s usually a problem that has come out.

 \[00:25:15\] One suggestion would be is to develop just that viruses to say hey listen we actually make this digest we\'ll make this actionable through these different ways because even the current kind of products that they\'re using are probably not actually giving them great information.

 \[00:25:30\] And so many people visited Dan in your sales pitch you already give like a little detail of that she\'s like this factor is highly correlated to this.

Then you have to take it the next step.

You say you can\'t stop there for this product to be compelling and for them to have it actionable.

Then you have to say like all right here are your options not at play and ideally you would have the kind of product that says like we\'ll take you there like we can help you finish things.

 \[00:25:51\] Is there any insights that you have in terms of or any anyway they\'re using data to compare retailers against each other or against a location.

 \[00:25:58\] Yeah.

So we\'re building.

This is something that would come with enough of a spread of solutions but we\'d like to build an industry wide benchmark customer behavior something that works because I think I mean what\'s tough about I think the business right now is what you\'re talking about is the commodity hardware that anything is you people or any network you don\'t have any network effects right now quite frankly like with benchmarking.

 \[00:26:21\] In my experience like Ivano like forms and service stuff a lot of people look at benchmarking numbers and they will immediately say like if it\'s again sort of what they want to hear they\'ll say like well make my companies different.

Right.

That doesn\'t apply to me.

Sure.

Right.

And then they\'ll continue doing what they want because they think like.

That\'s someone else either in my company you definitely would have yeah.

 \[00:26:39\] So like the reason it worries me so the picture I\'ll paint is you\'re talking about long sales cycles six months a year in a best case you don\'t get a year plus before you get money in the bank.

You\'re you.

There\'s not a very clear way to go from one real teller or the other and they just outbound sales so it\'s not like a consumer product in which there is some quote unquote virology or some way that you can you can move you so you could run out of money before you actually proved it would not have been a top selling right challenge.

 \[00:27:05\] What do you spend most your time on right now.

Product or sales numbers of a time of sales which makes sense.

Yes.

And then I think I\'d want to challenge that assumption that you said like we have to wait this long period of time because like sort of close Hipple like I\'d want you to like make people feel uncomfortable all the stuff but also like your whole thing is like we\'re providing value and you want to get started right now and if you get like on the ground floor with us with this like you\'re gonna get many benefits out of it.

 \[00:27:31\] Yeah.

Pilots have are definitely valuable in certain cases.

But the one downside and you could potentially experience that they actually don\'t really want it.

And as long as you\'re willing to do some free legwork for them they\'re like cool.

Maybe we\'ll get some insights maybe not.

Who cares.

 \[00:27:43\] So all the pilots are actually paid for today.

We\'ve generated about six figures of revenue just in the pilots alone.

And all customers go through private social pricing.

What\'s your pricing model.

It\'s a personal model.

So rather it\'s as per square metre model.

So a larger location single location pay a lot small locations lots of them pay a smaller amount.

Wideout rather than like recurring like it is a recurring role or a curse.

 \[00:28:07\] So where are these pilots right now.

Are there like three months in performance in the first of.

 \[00:28:14\] Is a month or so and right now Honkala is very recent you know very very recent long cell cycle to get there.

Yeah.

 \[00:28:22\] And then what do you have at the end of it that\'s going to tip them over like have you identified and set up a roadmap that sounds like okay if we achieved this.

Like you start seeing these sort of numbers and improvements then we sign up because like when I worried that like you\'re just collecting data and you\'re showing it to them and if they feel like Oh well I can\'t do any actionable with these things right now they\'re not going to see that there\'s any value yet the end of the six months or a year you realize Man is the answer.

I would do everything you can to say like OK.

You now see where you are.

While working with us.

We\'re going to help you drive those downwards or upwards depending on where they need to go.

 \[00:28:53\] So that\'s exactly it.

So the first the first conversations we had we figured out that leaving them to run the pilot in the room just wasn\'t going to work and they needed actually a fair bit of account management and handhold.

 \[00:29:04\] Yeah that\'s and that\'s what makes sense with the data right because that means you\'re really I mean you don\'t what you don\'t want to become becomes you don\'t the company become a consultancy essentially a consultancy.

 \[00:29:12\] So if you own a product business you basically have to be able to knock out a pilot and then start thinking about those sort of features that helps them get to the touchdown sort of moment not just the ones where there\'s sort of like identifying assessing nodes definitely about what we think we use actually is make sure that they focus on Arwin as we use our y as the key metric to determine at all.

 \[00:29:34\] I mean these there\'s other ways that you can like the 60 some pertly you know 50 60 percent that said do not use any sort of internal analytics.

And the ones that had nodes you there\'s going to be a rationalization for not to do this so that the Auro II has to be so clear that the industry assumes it\'s the standard but that\'s a very very very high benchmark for a young company to hit in the first year or two before money runs out.

And that\'s scary.

 \[00:30:00\] We\'re at a time fortunately but that no great pleasure talking to here.

Thanks Aaron.

 \[00:30:18\] What Kevin is telling him is our e-mail addresses so we can stay in touch.

I mean these guys are brave to in order to talk about their company in front of a front of a large group of people.

 \[00:30:27\] All right next one is third and last I\'m going to do something slightly different here.

Yes.

 \[00:30:33\] Screen pushed at me give me a round of applause applause.

Yeah yeah you got it.

 \[00:30:44\] Being founders you have to empathize with other founders.

This is not an easy easy job.

 \[00:30:49\] So first off Russian name and Tosspot screen push.

 \[00:30:55\] So my name is Woolite and screen push is essentially a screenshot collaboration tool.

So what we\'re doing is we\'re trying to target the the design digital design vertical.

And so we\'re really interested in kind of if youre redesigning lets say I can use web site you my you know maybe go to an agency which Kevin is literally doing you might go to an agency lets say instead of doing it yourself and what you don\'t want is that agency you give them the brief let\'s say you don\'t want that agency to go away 2 weeks later and say hey here it is full full final product.

 \[00:31:34\] Okay.

So.

So it makes it easier for designers to collaborate or a person in the company to collaborate with somebody outside their company by sharing their screen.

 \[00:31:41\] So yeah like kind of two fold in the sense that it gives us like tool that allows the designers.

 \[00:31:46\] Here\'s the thing I\'m worried about like we\'re gone several sentences into this and I don\'t know exactly what the thing is.

OK.

You just told me about like this is the kind of solution.

And there\'s you talk a little bit about the problem.

Yes.

 \[00:31:57\] So I think a desktop application does start with that desktop application that the designers download themselves and then keyboard shortcut to actually send the current version that they\'re designing to the other designer.

While each and every screenshot is kind of saved and organized in a timeline so that the client can then go onto a Web site not have to download any kind of desktop application.

 \[00:32:19\] That\'s a good place to start.

In terms of you talk about copy for your actual landing page is that you actually want to describe.

You can start off with a very verbose what you literally do and then pare it down as a good so don\'t pick on you.

 \[00:32:30\] But this is actually a typical problem that we see all the time especially as investors a lot of founders the reason that they start their company is around the Y.

Right.

The problem whatever the inspiration for them getting into the space is like it\'s the passion that sort of fuels them but for people who like see tons of pitches over and over again.

The problem that we have from our perspective is just like remembering what you do.

So we really need that first right make sure we understand that and then if we\'re interested we\'re going to prompt you and pull out of you all the whys the passion and all that stuff.

Okay.

However we\'re going to stop here and agilely a lot of the kind of office hours that CASA and I do at C is actually you X reviews and we go through people sign up for flows and stuff.

 \[00:33:13\] And so we want to do something different here.

And they were literally going to go through the center of the product and give us our thoughts and hear why you made decisions that you made.

Sure.

Okay.

So once you turn around so you can see.

And then the way we did this because we do want to take a chance of trying to do like a lot them or what have you.

I just went through the product through design flow and it took like a billion screenshots going through that experience.

I\'m just going to sort of narrate and go through it here.

So here\'s the front page screen push and this is the top third of it so is a shot collaboration made easy.

And then the next sentence is collaboration.

It\'s what we do.

And literally I think Karzai and I both thought exactly like what you do.

 \[00:33:56\] But really we\'re doing something together I wonder what it is.

 \[00:34:04\] So if we scroll down the page further and he talks a little bit about his features here.

So in descriptions of each team member is assigned a specific shortcut notifications are subtle gentle and understanding.

 \[00:34:16\] The punchline here is really no one would read this.

We\'d probably already be at the bottom of the page.

 \[00:34:19\] Right  \[00:34:19\] okay.

So cross paths compatible and I\'m starting to get the first hint by looking at one screenshot and it says Mac Windows.

Check check that.

Oh this is a desktop app right.

Then the last part says looks familiar.

Thought so.

Say goodbye to the screenshot graveyard forever.

So now it is the first time I hear about like this is some kind of problem that is sort of solving but I don\'t know exactly what it is.

 \[00:34:41\] There should be an image to be fair on the left that demonstrates what is the screenshot graveyard.

But that may have not came up OK.

 \[00:34:51\] It happens it\'s understandable so I think that just a bit before we go into the actual sign of flow.

 \[00:34:58\] The punch line here is if you sat down you know there\'s hundreds of people here.

Yeah with your site and said hey listen I\'m an intern or I got hired by this company called Tigrean push.

What do you think this page is after looking at it for not like we\'ve already talked for five minutes within you know 500 milliseconds or two seconds or three seconds four seconds.

I don\'t think any of them would get what you think your company is.

Yeah that is a big deal because that\'s how most people go to discover your product.

That\'s kind of a meta piece of advice as you have all these things that you know what you mean by the word collaboration.

Yeah but not clever means lots of things lots exact.

 \[00:35:31\] I think it\'s become like this big buzz word and we got drawn into that.

So it\'s like yeah we\'re collaborators using his wife\'s right here.

Exactly.

And we got drawn into that kind of the same with like big Dana everybody uses these words and everybody has completely different interpretations and we definitely.

 \[00:35:47\] So one thing I would say positive before we\'re going to move on to it is though it is a beautiful sight.

It\'s wild.

I mean it\'s it\'s visually well-designed.

 \[00:35:53\] Are you copyrighted.

Did you read the copy.

Did I tell you.

So like how do you recommend you guys like go through the site you to sign it float because there\'s some really nice copy in terms of the sign up in terms of the e-mail that he sends.

All right.

And then real office I we wouldn\'t compliment you we just go on to the next.

OK.

So I went through and you click on the button and you go through a sign of procedure that goes on.

So what\'s your e-mail.

The password yeah.

Can you tell me your name.

And then what do you do.

And this will place.

Hazarajat stuff.

Yeah.

I mean it\'s so beautiful it\'s in line I think that\'s great.

It\'s it\'s a unique sign a process.

But literally what you do.

I didn\'t know what to put there.

I think the example you have the front end dev.

Yeah.

 \[00:36:29\] Product manager should invest I.

I don\'t know what to do.

And then if you go back one slide two slides I\'m sorry you don\'t know his full name or password there\'s no indication of this is alphanumeric how long and so what ends up happening is when I got I got an error state at the end of the sign flow.

Okay which is very frustrating because that already gone through a bunch of questions and then I had to figure out.

That\'s when it closed the browser sharing.

 \[00:36:53\] All right.

So you go through it and then it does this nice pause and it says like you\'ve got mail which was a really nice touch just like some a little different.

And so I go and check my e-mail and I get into the app and then the first thing it shows me is this screen right here it says my team.

You did it.

Let\'s get started.

Oh you don\'t seem to have created any teams yet.

Let\'s get started.

We got repetition there start a lot and then team name and team and then team invites.

And so the first thing I\'m thinking is also like I don\'t know what this is the first thing I do not want to do is send it to my friends.

Right.

Yeah.

So like this would not be the ideal setting.

And as desktop software a lot of times the hardest part is like getting them then source software.

So yeah that didn\'t start off with that yet which is why I went to because I was like Let me see what it is before I send it to any friends cool.

So go and download it.

So it goes here.

No convenient shortcut linked to the applications folder.

So people are falling all left and right where you have one soul left.

So here the connect through it and then what happens when you like open is absolutely nothing like clears away.

And I was like I\'m going to start what\'s going on.

And you\'d have to notice and this is the S with the hexagon that that icon appeared and the top dog like you did know that the only indication right that it started and you\'re into it.

So I click on here and I see user name and I\'m like I don\'t remember adding new user to my fellow mottling.

It was important to me.

I don\'t know what\'s going on.

And I go back through and I actually go back to the account and I said like oh let me just log into the app and when I come back here there\'s no link to log in.

So I\'m like OK well let me refresh because I remember this thing showed up dynamically and then I\'m like I don\'t sealing the log in.

And it took me a while to realize the order ready registered the way I get to log in subtle.

I finally get there.

I actually had to go through a password reset theme at some point.

Good copy.

Make a really great copy in the places that you sort of catch me.

I think that\'s like sort of like what got me through it.

So we get to reset password.

I do this and this actually this page just refreshes backward.

But there has no confirmation on it except there\'s an e-mail you do send me and that\'s only way I know that the password to read that so I probably hit that with a typo 10 10000 times.

Right.

And so when I finally like because I did it like five times and I don\'t know which password I actually got accepted.

So I eventually get logged in and I sit here and I\'m finally here and I\'m like I don\'t know what this is to do.

The thing I think is like oh I put the biggest button on here.

Yeah.

So the button click is what do you think.

Yeah.

Because it\'s the most has the greatest sort of afford it.

And of course it\'s like a feedback e-mail form.

So OK that\'s nice.

I think you hit the hexagon push thing and it takes a screen shot and then that is all it does.

It\'s like a crop cone at Y Combinator and a check and an axe.

I\'m like What am I checking.

What am I crossing off.

I don\'t know what\'s happening.

And eventually I check it off and go back to the eye to see any clues about it and there really isn\'t anything there yet.

So anyway so that is very harsh.

 \[00:40:16\] You know in regular office hours in regular office hours we would really be going step by step and really figure out like what would be better copy here what did the individual think literally Chicago called for time what would we actually change and every single one of those scripts and very tactical and it\'s mundane boring but like that\'s what building makes somebody like all that up front making progress but seeing it that way you can see like every place that I had a problem and just the fact that that slide deck had like 25 Sligh.

 \[00:40:43\] Yeah.

 \[00:40:44\] Before I got to the part where I\'m logged in the point I would take way for you guys who are all building products right now.

You should do what Kevin and I basically did here which is have people who don\'t know your product use it all the time.

I\'m talking about every single day meeting people who don\'t know what your company does and letting them actually go to the kind of flow their first interactions because that means you you\'re just so caught in your own company.

Yeah that you know you don\'t realize like the most basic things like it\'s a desktop app is not obvious yet and therefore you know it becomes a real fundamental product.

Awesome.

All right.

So those are not normal hours.

We\'ll do regular conversation with them offstage.

Yeah.

 \[00:41:23\] So we\'re at 4 o\'clock now.

I think we\'re having a break until 4:00 30.

We will see you then.

Thanks guys.

Thank you.
